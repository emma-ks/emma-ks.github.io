	abstract = {The establishment of interdisciplinary Master’s and PhD programs in sustainability science is opening up an exciting arena filled with opportunities for early-career scholars to address pressing sustainability challenges. However, embarking upon an interdisciplinary endeavor as an early-career scholar poses a unique set of challenges: to develop an individual scientific identity and a strong and specific methodological skill-set, while at the same time gaining the ability to understand and communicate between different epistemologies. Here, we explore the challenges and opportunities that emerge from a new kind of interdisciplinary journey, which we describe as ‘undisciplinary.’ Undisciplinary describes (1) the space or condition of early-career researchers with early interdisciplinary backgrounds, (2) the process of the journey, and (3) the orientation which aids scholars to address the complex nature of today’s sustainability challenges. The undisciplinary journey is an iterative and reflexive process of balancing methodological groundedness and epistemological agility to engage in rigorous sustainability science. The paper draws upon insights from a collective journey of broad discussion, reflection, and learning, including a survey on educational backgrounds of different generations of sustainability scholars, participatory forum theater, and a panel discussion at the Resilience 2014 conference (Montpellier, France). Based on the results from this diversity of methods, we suggest that there is now a new and distinct generation of sustainability scholars that start their careers with interdisciplinary training, as opposed to only engaging in interdisciplinary research once strong disciplinary foundations have been built. We further identify methodological groundedness and epistemological agility as guiding competencies to become capable sustainability scientists and discuss the implications of an undisciplinary journey in the current institutional context of universities and research centers. In this paper, we propose a simple framework to help early-career sustainability scholars and well-established scientists successfully navigate what can sometimes be an uncomfortable space in education and research, with the ultimate aim of producing and engaging in rigorous and impactful sustainability science.},

Research question/motivation/purpose


How could we ‘perform high-quality research and build identity in the field of sustainability science, when starting as interdisciplinary individuals without profound roots in a discipline, and working within a world dominated by established disciplines?’ 


talks about the undisciplinary process as a way to frame thinking around the different types of disciplinarity (trans/cross/multi/etc)




Theory


Methods


the paper does a survey, forum theater, and then facilitated a deeper discussion with established researchers to provide advice for newer ID researchers




Relevant context


study carried out at a sustainability/resilience conference with sustainability scholars




Results/implications/conclusions


established sustainability researchers call themselves interdisciplinary more often than younger scholars who are more often trained in truly interdisciplinary fields than their older counterparts


younger scholars may feel more tied to actually being part of a discipline so that they are accepted, depends on the path/goals of younger scholars




CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF WORK


Why this study matters


defines the “journey” of the “undisciplinary”


thinking about being problem driven instead of knowledge driven


discusses the importance of collaboration  


thinking about how to situate yourself if what types of knowing




Assumptions it makes







Limitations


don’t love the term undisciplinary


would be curious to see a follow up study now to see if any seniments have changed




Reliability/caveats


the chart with conceptual lala land vs epistemological




REFLECTIONS


How this work applies to your own question


really liked the concept of EA and want to internalize this in my own work

	abstract = {Working across knowledge-based research programmes, rather than institutional structures, should be central to interdisciplinary research. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to facilitate interdisciplinary research, with the goals of promoting communication, understanding and collaborative work. Three core elements need to be addressed to improve interdisciplinary research: the types (forms and functions) of theories, the underlying philosophies of knowledge and the combination of research styles; these three elements combine to form the research programme. Case studies from sustainability science and environmental security illustrate the application of this research programme-based framework. This framework may be helpful in overcoming often oversimplified distinctions, such as qualitative/quantitative, deductive/inductive, normative/descriptive, subjective/objective and theory/practice. Applying this conceptual framework to interdisciplinary research should foster theoretical advances, more effective communication and better problem-solving in increasingly interdisciplinary environmental fields.},

	abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is widely used in ecology and conservation. Currently, the most available data for SDM are species presence-only records (available through digital databases). There have been many studies comparing the performance of alternative algorithms for modeling presence-only data. Among these, a 2006 paper from Elith and colleagues has been particularly influential in the field, partly because they used several novel methods (at the time) on a global data set that included independent presence–absence records for model evaluation. Since its publication, some of the algorithms have been further developed and new ones have emerged. In this paper, we explore patterns in predictive performance across methods, by reanalyzing the same data set (225 species from six different regions) using updated modeling knowledge and practices. We apply well-established methods such as generalized additive models and MaxEnt, alongside others that have received attention more recently, including regularized regressions, point-process weighted regressions, random forests, XGBoost, support vector machines, and the ensemble modeling framework biomod. All the methods we use include background samples (a sample of environments in the landscape) for model fitting. We explore impacts of using weights on the presence and background points in model fitting. We introduce new ways of evaluating models fitted to these data, using the area under the precision-recall gain curve, and focusing on the rank of results. We find that the way models are fitted matters. The top method was an ensemble of tuned individual models. In contrast, ensembles built using the biomod framework with default parameters performed no better than single moderate performing models. Similarly, the second top performing method was a random forest parameterized to deal with many background samples (contrasted to relatively few presence records), which substantially outperformed other random forest implementations. We find that, in general, nonparametric techniques with the capability of controlling for model complexity outperformed traditional regression methods, with MaxEnt and boosted regression trees still among the top performing models. All the data and code with working examples are provided to make this study fully reproducible.},

	abstract = {The societal risks of water scarcity and water-quality impairment have received considerable attention, evidenced by recent analyses of these topics by the 2030 Water Resources Group, the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. What are the effects of fire on the predicted water scarcity and declines in water quality? Drinking water supplies for humans, the emphasis of this exploration, are derived from several land cover types, including forests, grasslands and peatlands, which are vulnerable to fire. In the last two decades, fires have affected the water supply catchments of Denver (CO) and other southwestern US cities, and four major Australian cities including Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne. In the same time period, several, though not all, national, regional and global water assessments have included fire in evaluations of the risks that affect water supplies. The objective of this discussion is to explore the nexus of fire, water and society with the hope that a more explicit understanding of fire effects on water supplies will encourage the incorporation of fire into future assessments of water supplies, into the pyrogeography conceptual framework and into planning efforts directed at water resiliency.

We show that annual river flow changed in 32 locations, where more than 19\% of the basin area was burned. Wildland fires enhanced annual river flow in the western regions with a warm temperate or humid continental climate. Wildland fires increased annual river flow most in the semi-arid Lower Colorado region, in spite of frequent droughts in this region. In contrast, prescribed burns in the subtropical Southeast did not significantly alter river flow. These extremely variable outcomes offer new insights into the potential role of wildfire and prescribed fire in regional water resource management, under a changing climate.},

In both disasters, drinking water exceeded state and federal government-defined exposure limits for several volatile organic compound (VOC) contaminants (e.g., benzene at 40,000 µg/L [Tubbs] and {\textgreater}2,217 µg/L [Camp]). This work outlines factors that influence wildfire-induced drinking water quality threats based on the findings from these two fires and explores related scientific and policy issues. For example, certain plastics in the network may serve as a primary VOC source through in situ plastic pyrolysis. Depressurization of the distribution network likely transported contaminated water that subsequently contaminated undamaged infrastructure. As wildfires at the wildland–urban interface are likely to occur more frequently, greater scientific evidence is needed to guide agency responses that will better protect public health.},

	abstract = {Background
Mapping the spatial distribution of the dengue vector Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and accurately predicting its abundance are crucial for designing effective vector control strategies and early warning tools for dengue epidemic prevention. Socio-ecological and landscape factors influence Ae. aegypti abundance. Therefore, we aimed to map the spatial distribution of female adult Ae. aegypti and predict its abundance in northeastern Thailand based on socioeconomic, climate change, and dengue knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) and/or landscape factors using machine learning (ML)-based system.
Method
A total of 1066 females adult Ae. aegypti were collected from four villages in northeastern Thailand during January–December 2019. Information on household socioeconomics, KAP regarding climate change and dengue, and satellite-based landscape data were also acquired. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to map the household-based spatial distribution of female adult Ae. aegypti abundance (high/low). Five popular supervised learning models, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF), were used to predict females adult Ae. aegypti abundance (high/low). The predictive accuracy of each modeling technique was calculated and evaluated. Important variables for predicting female adult Ae. aegypti abundance were also identified using the best-fitted model.
Results
Urban areas had higher abundance of female adult Ae. aegypti compared to rural areas. Overall, study respondents in both urban and rural areas had inadequate KAP regarding climate change and dengue. The average landscape factors per household in urban areas were rice crop (47.4\%), natural tree cover (17.8\%), built-up area (13.2\%), permanent wetlands (21.2\%), and rubber plantation (0\%), and the corresponding figures for rural areas were 12.1, 2.0, 38.7, 40.1 and 0.1\% respectively. Among all assessed models, RF showed the best prediction performance (socioeconomics: area under curve, AUC = 0.93, classification accuracy, CA = 0.86, F1 score = 0.85; KAP: AUC = 0.95, CA = 0.92, F1 = 0.90; landscape: AUC = 0.96, CA = 0.89, F1 = 0.87) for female adult Ae. aegypti abundance. The combined influences of all factors further improved the predictive accuracy in RF model (socioeconomics + KAP + landscape: AUC = 0.99, CA = 0.96 and F1 = 0.95). Dengue prevention practices were shown to be the most important predictor in the RF model for female adult Ae. aegypti abundance in northeastern Thailand.
Conclusion
The RF model is more suitable for the prediction of Ae. aegypti abundance in northeastern Thailand. Our study exemplifies that the application of GIS and machine learning systems has significant potential for understanding the spatial distribution of dengue vectors and predicting its abundance. The study findings might help optimize vector control strategies, future mosquito suppression, prediction and control strategies of epidemic arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). Such strategies can be incorporated into One Health approaches applying transdisciplinary approaches considering human-vector and agro-environmental interrelationships.},

The emergence and introduction throughout tropical and subtropical countries of the chikungunya virus, as of 2014, challenged Costa Rican health authorities to provide a correct diagnosis since it is also transmitted by the same vector and infected hosts may share similar symptoms. We study the 2015–2016 dengue and chikungunya outbreaks in Costa Rica while establishing how point estimates of epidemic parameters for both diseases compare to one another. Longitudinal weekly incidence reports of these outbreaks signal likely misdiagnosis of infected individuals: underreporting of chikungunya cases, while overreporting cases of dengue. Our comparative analysis is formulated with a single-outbreak deterministic model that features an undiagnosed class. Additionally, we also used a genetic algorithm in the context of weighted least squares to calculate point estimates of key model parameters and initial conditions, while formally quantifying misdiagnosis.},

	abstract = {Dengue fever affects over a 100 million people annually hence is one of the world's most important vector-borne diseases. The transmission area of this disease continues to expand due to many direct and indirect factors linked to urban sprawl, increased travel and global warming. Current preventative measures include mosquito control programs, yet due to the complex nature of the disease and the increased importation risk along with the lack of efficient prophylactic measures, successful disease control and elimination is not realistic in the foreseeable future. Epidemiological models attempt to predict future outbreaks using information on the risk factors of the disease. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims at analyzing the different modeling methods and their outputs in terms of acting as an early warning system. We found that many previous studies have not sufficiently accounted for the spatio-temporal features of the disease in the modeling process. Yet with advances in technology, the ability to incorporate such information as well as the socio-environmental aspect allowed for its use as an early warning system, albeit limited geographically to a local scale.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation of forests are among the biggest threats to biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. We use the vicinity of the Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica as a regional case study to document seven decades of land-use change in one of the most intensively studied sites in the Neotropics. Though the premontane wet forest was largely intact in 1947, a wave of immigration in 1952 initiated rapid changes over a short period. Overall forest cover was reduced during each time interval analyzed (1947–1960, 1960–1980, 1980–1997, 1997–2014), although the vast majority of forest loss ({\textgreater}90\%) occurred during the first two time intervals (1947–1960, 1960–1980) with an annual deforestation rate of 2.14\% and 3.86\%, respectively. The rate dropped to {\textless}2\% thereafter and has been offset by forest recovery in fallow areas more recently, but overall forest cover has continued to decline. Approximately 27.9\% of the study area is forested currently. Concomitantly, the region shifted from a single contiguous forest to a series of progressively smaller forest fragments with each successive survey. A strong reduction in the amount of core habitat was paralleled by an increased proportion of edge habitat, due to the irregular shape of many forest fragments. Structural connectivity, however, remains high, with an expansive network of {\textgreater}100 km of linear strips of vegetation within a 3 km radius of the station, which may facilitate landscape-level movement for some species. Despite the extent of forest loss, a substantial number of regional landscape-level studies over the past two decades have demonstrated the persistence of many groups of organisms such as birds and mammals. Nonetheless, the continued decline in the quantity and quality of remaining habitat ({\textasciitilde}30\% of remaining forest is secondary), as well as the threat of an extinction debt (or time lag in species loss), may result in the extirpation of additional species if more proactive conservation measures are not taken to reverse current trends–a pattern that reflects many other tropical regions the world over.},

	abstract = {Changes in land-use and the associated shifts in environmental conditions can have large effects on the transmission and emergence of mosquito-borne disease. Mosquito-borne disease are particularly sensitive to these changes because mosquito growth, reproduction, survival and susceptibility to infection are all thermally sensitive traits, and land use change dramatically alters local microclimate. Predicting disease transmission under environmental change is increasingly critical for targeting mosquito-borne disease control and for identifying hotspots of disease emergence. Mechanistic models offer a powerful tool for improving these predictions. However, these approaches are limited by the quality and scale of temperature data and the thermal response curves that underlie predictions. Here, we used fine-scale temperature monitoring and a combination of empirical, laboratory and temperature-dependent estimates to estimate the vectorial capacity of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes across a tropical forest–oil palm plantation conversion gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We found that fine-scale differences in temperature between logged forest and oil palm plantation sites were not sufficient to produce differences in temperature-dependent demographic trait estimates using published thermal performance curves. However, when measured under field conditions a key parameter, adult abundance, differed significantly between land-use types, resulting in estimates of vectorial capacity that were 1.5 times higher in plantations than in forests. The prediction that oil palm plantations would support mosquito populations with higher vectorial capacity was robust to uncertainties in our adult survival estimates. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the effects of forest conversion to agriculture on mosquito-borne disease risk, and a framework for interpreting emergent relationships between land-use and disease transmission. As the burden of Ae. albopictus-vectored diseases, such as dengue virus, increases globally and rising demand for palm oil products drives continued expansion of plantations, these findings have important implications for conservation, land management and public health policy at the global scale.},

	abstract = {As the climate warms, wildfire activity is increasing, posing a risk to human health. Studies have reported on particulate matter (PM) in wildfire smoke, yet the chemicals associated with PM have received considerably less attention. Here, we analyzed 13 years (2006–2018) of PM2.5 chemical composition data from monitors in California on smoke-impacted days. Select chemicals (e.g., aluminum and sulfate) were statistically elevated on smoke-impacted days in over half of the years studied. Other chemicals, mostly trace metals harmful to human health (e.g., copper and lead), were elevated during particular fires only. For instance, in 2018, lead was more than 40 times higher on smoke days on average at the Point Reyes monitoring station due mostly to the Camp Fire, burning approximately 200 kilometers away. There was an association between these metals and the combustion of anthropogenic material (e.g., the burning of houses and vehicles). Although still currently rare, these infrastructure fires are likely becoming more common, and can mobilize trace metals in smoke far downwind, at levels generally unseen except in the most polluted areas of the country. We hope a better understanding of the chemicals in wildfire smoke will assist in the communication and reduction of public health risks.},

	abstract = {Wildfires have increased in frequency and severity over the past two decades, threatening to undo substantial air quality improvements. We investigate the relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and learning outcomes across the United States using standardized test scores from 2009–2016 for nearly 11,700 school districts and satellite-derived estimates of daily smoke exposure. Relative to a school year with no smoke, average cumulative smoke-attributable PM2.5 (surface particulate matter {\textless}2.5 μg m−3) exposure during the school year ({\textasciitilde}35 μg m−3) reduces test scores by {\textasciitilde}0.15\% of a standard deviation. These impacts are more pronounced among younger students and are observed across differing levels of economic disadvantage and racial/ethnic composition. Additionally, we project that smoke PM2.5 exposure in 2016 reduced discounted future earnings by nearly \$1.7 billion (\$111 per student). Roughly 80\% of these costs are borne by disadvantaged districts. Our findings quantify a previously unaccounted for social cost of wildfire that is likely to worsen under a warming climate.},

	abstract = {ConspectusWildfires are a natural part of most forest ecosystems, but due to changing climatic and environmental conditions, they have become larger, more severe, and potentially more damaging. Forested watersheds vulnerable to wildfire serve as drinking water supplies for many urban and rural communities. The highly variable nature of wildfire behavior combined with spatially complex patterns in vegetation, landscape, and hydrologic factors create uncertainty surrounding the postfire effects on water supplies. Wildfires often cause dramatic changes in forest vegetation structure and soil conditions, and alter the watershed processes that control streamflow, soil erosion, nutrient export, and downstream water chemistry. The authors’ work centers on field and laboratory studies to advance knowledge of postfire changes in soil and water chemical composition that influence drinking water treatment. High intensity postfire rainstorms typically increase runoff that erodes ash and soil from burned landscapes and dramatically elevates turbidity, nutrient, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in surface waters, which can cause short-term challenges for water providers. There is also growing evidence that water quality impacts can persist after high severity fires due to slow vegetative recovery, and nitrogen and DOC have remained elevated for 15 years following high severity fire. Low-moderate temperatures during wildfire may also influence water quality. Research by the authors showed that the solubility of organic matter, and C and N released from soils increased following soil heating at temperatures ≤ 350 °C. Further, the water extracted organic matter from soils heated at 225–350 °C included higher proportions of condensed aromatic structures, such as black carbon and black nitrogen. Short-term postfire water quality degradation following high intensity rainstorms can force water treatment plants to shut down or can significantly challenge treatment process performance. Extreme turbidity and high DOC in poststorm water, coupled with compositional organic matter changes, reduced the coagulation efficiency of postfire water supplies. Field and lab-based studies documented the formation of small, aromatic soluble compounds during wildfire that contribute to inefficient DOC removal from postfire stormwater. Due to increased postfire DOC concentrations, and poor treatability of poststorm runoff, toxic disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation increased during water treatment. Exceedance of drinking water standards for the carbonaceous DBPs, trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, may present a critical management concern for water providers following wildfires. Further, postfire formation of nitrogen compounds and increased nitrogenous DBP precursors for haloacetonitriles and chloropicrin were discovered. N-DBPs pose a public health concern due to their toxicity, and water providers should be aware of potential increases in N-DBP formation following fire. Evidence from the authors’ studies demonstrates that even partially burned watersheds and wildfires burning at moderate temperature can have significant, lasting effects on C and N exports, source water quality, drinking water treatability, and DBP formation. Both short- and long-term postfire water quality impacts can create challenges for drinking water providers as they confront variability in supply and treatability. Communities, forest managers, and potable water providers will need to adapt to more frequent, destructive wildfires and anticipate greater variability in water quality.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits ecosystems provide to society. These services grant the necessary conditions for sustaining life and influence human well-being in all dimensions, including providing basic needs, health, and freedom of choice and action (MEA 2005). ES include all contributions of nature to humans, and these are relative according to the context and the existence of alternatives (IPBES 2019). Ecosystem degradation jeopardizes the sustainable provision of these services. In this context, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes arose as policy instruments that promote pro-environmental land use through financial incentives for actions that improve, maintain, or maximize the provision of ES (Kim et al. 2016). Since the late 1990s, PES schemes have spread worldwide, adopting different payment types, scales, and conservation objectives (Salzmann et al. 2018). Some incentivized activities are forest conservation, watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and carbon (C) sequestration and storage.

One central area for improvement of most PES is their need for ES measurement. Due to the technical difficulty and high cost of measuring and monitoring ES periodically, most PES only monitor land uses and practices granted under PES contracts. Overall, PES have been based on the premise that, by incentivizing forest conservation and reforestation of nonforest areas, the flow of ES of interest to society is maintained or increased. However, this presumed correlation may be nonlinear, asynchronous in time and space, could involve trade-offs among ES at the landscape scale, and, in the worst-case scenario, the …},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services has been widely explored in various theoretical or practical studies since its emergence more than 20 years ago. The two big issues in the past golden era of ecosystem services research were: ecosystem services valuing and ecosystem services trade-offs. We analyzed advantages of ecosystem services in promoting the attention that government and the public pay to the natural capital and the management of ecosystem services, together with summarizing the shortcomings. It was found that ecosystem services valuing made the public aware of the importance of natural capital from an economic perspective, while ecosystem services trade-offs highlighted the relationship between various ecosystem services from an ecological perspective, which could be better applied to ecosystem services-based ecosystem management. With an increasing number of papers focusing on ecosystem services flows, it is believed that ecosystem services flows integrating ecology, economy, sociology and geography disciplines will become a new key direction after ecosystem services valuing and trade-offs. To further promote the study of ecosystem services flows that link human and nature within geographical context, we need to focus on the value of ecosystem services flows with payment and benefit accounting, the relationship of ecosystem services flows by trade-off and synergy analysis, and the direction of ecosystem services flows by spatial and temporal assessment. In addition, a more efficient and widely recognized method is also essential for the development of quantifying ecosystem services flow. This study contributes to understanding the development stage of ecosystem services research and highlights the importance of ecosystem services flow research.},

	abstract = {Pesticides are used globally in agriculture and pose a threat to the health of farmers, communities, and the environment. Smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries have generally a low socio-economic status and educational level. Consequently, they are particularly vulnerable to negative impacts of pesticides on their health, yields, or land. In a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices study, we compared the pest management practices between a market-oriented farming system in Zarcero County, Costa Rica, and a subsistence-based farming system in Wakiso District, Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among smallholder farmers from Costa Rica (n = 300) in 2016 and from Uganda (n = 302) in 2017. We enrolled conventional and organic farmers, but also farmers with mixed practices and non-applicators of any pest management strategy. We found that the majority of pesticides used in both case studies are classified as highly hazardous by the World Health Organization. While more than 90\% of smallholder farmers from both countries were aware of the negative health effects of pesticide exposure, {\textless}11\% in Costa Rica and {\textless}2\% in Uganda reported using personal protective equipment every time they handled or applied pesticides. Hygiene and other safe use practices were not adopted by all farmers ({\textless}61\%), especially among farmers applying more hazardous pesticides. Conventional farmers from Costa Rica (14\%) and Uganda (19\%) reported disposing pesticide residuals into rivers. Using a logistic regression we found that organic farmers were more likely to having been trained on safe pesticide use practices. Using a robust regression, we observed that smallholder household income was primarily driven by education and not directly by the use of synthetic pesticides. Our results suggest that negative effects of pesticides can be managed over the whole life cycle, from purchase, via storage and application to residual and waste management by fostering professionalization of farmers. We advise future safe use and handling interventions to consider the pesticide use-related socioeconomic and demographic findings highlighted in this paper.},

The ensemble SDM included predictions based on seven different algorithms, 110 occurrence records and 70 model projections.

Goodness of fit for the ensemble SDM was very high, with a minimum AUC of 0.79. We used the resulting ensemble SDM to evaluate differences in habitat suitability (HS) between commercial plantations and surrounding landscapes, finding a higher HS in pineapple and oil palm plantations, suggestive of An. albimanus presence, than in surrounding landscapes. The ensemble SDM suggested a low HS for An. albimanus at the presumed epicenter of malaria transmission during 2018–2019 in Costa Rica, yet this vector was likely present at the two main towns also affected by the epidemic.

	abstract = {Background
Although many mosquito species develop within agricultural landscapes where they are potentially exposed to agricultural chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides), the effects of these chemicals on mosquito biology remain poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of four agricultural chemicals on the life history traits of Anopheles arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes.

Methods
Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to examine how sublethal concentrations of four agricultural chemicals: an insecticide (cypermethrin), a herbicide (glyphosate), and two nitrogenous fertilizers (ammonium sulfate and diammonium phosphate) alter oviposition site selection, emergence rates, development time, adult body size, and longevity of An. arabiensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus.

Results
Both mosquito species had preference to oviposit in fertilizer treatments relative to pesticide treatments. Emergence rates for An. arabiensis were significantly higher in the control and ammonium sulfate treatments compared to cypermethrin treatment, while emergence rates for Cx. quinquefasciatus were significantly higher in the diammonium phosphate treatment compared to glyphosate and cypermethrin treatments. For both mosquito species, individuals from the ammonium sulfate and diammonium phosphate treatments took significantly longer time to develop compared to those from cypermethrin and glyphosate treatments. Although not always significant, males and females of both mosquito species tended to be smaller in the ammonium sulfate and diammonium phosphate treatments compared to cypermethrin and glyphosate treatments. There was no significant effect of the agrochemical treatments on the longevity of either mosquito species.

Conclusions
These results demonstrate that the widespread use of agricultural chemicals to enhance crop production can have unexpected effects on the spatial distribution and abundance of mosquito vectors of malaria and lymphatic filariasis.},

In this paper, we generalize SCM, originally designed to study a single treated unit, to the staggered adoption setting. We first bound the error for the average effect and show that it depends on both the imbalance for each treated unit separately and the imbalance for the average of the treated units. We then propose "partially pooled" SCM weights to minimize a weighted combination of these measures; approaches that focus only on balancing one of the two components can lead to bias. We extend this approach to incorporate unit-level intercept shifts and auxiliary covariates. We assess the performance of the proposed method via extensive simulations and apply our results to the question of whether teacher collective bargaining leads to higher school spending, finding minimal impacts. We implement the proposed method in the augsynth R package.},

PIXE (particle induced X-ray emission) analysis of particles identified 18 elements, thereby achieving an elemental characterization. In order to calculate the risk posed by each element, the dose of elemental exposure was considered in relation to the corresponding reference dose. This gave an elemental risk of less than 1 for the three age groups; however, when the additive risk is considered for each age group a value exceeding 1 is obtained. Hence, although no individual element represents a public health risk, a consideration of the total risk for each of the age groups shows that members of the population are at high risk of contracting any one of the diseases that can be caused by the elements present in PM2.5.},

	abstract = {Over the past three decades, China has experienced rapid urbanization. The risks to its urban population posed by inhalation exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) have not been well characterized. Here, we summarize recent measurements of 16 highly prevalent HAPs in urban China and compile their distribution inputs. Based on activity patterns of urban Chinese working adults, we derive personal exposures. Using a probabilistic risk assessment method, we determine cancer and non-cancer risks for working females and males. We also assess the uncertainty associated with risk estimates using Monte Carlo simulation, accounting for variations in HAP concentrations, cancer potency factors (CPFs) and inhalation rates. Average total lifetime cancer risks attributable to HAPs are 2.27×10−4 (2.27 additional cases per 10,000 people exposed) and 2.93×10−4 for Chinese urban working females and males, respectively. Formaldehyde, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene and 1,3-butadiene are the major risk contributors yielding the highest median cancer risk estimates, {\textgreater}1×10−5. About 70\% of the risk is due to exposures occurring in homes. Outdoor sources contribute most to the risk of benzene, ethylbenzene and carbon tetrachloride, while indoor sources dominate for all other compounds. Chronic exposure limits are not exceeded for non-carcinogenic effects, except for formaldehyde. Risks are overestimated if variation is not accounted for. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the major contributors to total variance are range of inhalation rates, CPFs of formaldehyde, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene and 1,3-butadiene, and indoor home concentrations of formaldehyde and benzene. Despite uncertainty, risks exceeding the acceptable benchmark of 1×10−6 suggest actions to reduce exposures. Future efforts should be directed toward large-scale measurements of air pollutant concentrations, refinement of CPFs and investigation of population exposure parameters. The present study is a first effort to estimate carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of inhalation exposure to HAPs for the large working populations of Chinese cites.},

mean + max temps increasing 4-6 degrees Celsius in the next 100 yrs -{\textgreater} how will these changes impact us?


temp change ALONE impact populations nad communities maintaining environmental factors


GOAL: how does temp shape ecottherm growth, how does this interact with other env factors, what are the consequences of these interactions for predicting the effects of rising temps on species + communities
fundamentally:


temp = biologically/chemically changing reactions rates


“unimodal function describing the dependence of growth or other process on temperature is called the thermal performance curve (TPC)” 


“These parameters can be thought of as traits, and are often used to assess species’ vulnerability to high or low temperatures and define their thermal niches” 




“This resource-dependence of temperature responses is not limited to photosynthetic organisms” 


“two recent models have examined temperature–resource (nutrient/food) interactions influence populations, or equivalently, how resource limitation alters TPCs” 


thomas et al developed model to look at temp-resource interactions


thermal sensitivies of energy gain and metabolism


“Aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems with pronounced resource limitation may be more adversely affected by warming than ecosystems that are not resource-limited. Nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus or iron) limitation is widespread in the oceans and is predicted to become even more prevalent in the future” 


“global ocean nitrate concentration, temperature and the regions where the lowest nitrate concentration and highest temperatures overlap. Such areas appear predominantly in the tropics.” 


“These feedbacks between temperature and nutrients have not yet been adequately incorporated into our predictions of the global change effects on organisms, populations and communities.” 
“Optimizing crops for future heat waves may require approaches that increase mutualist abundance and resource availability while decreasing disease prevalence.” 
“A focused research agenda to investigate systematically the effects of multiple interacting stressors on species’ TPCs from a wide range of habitats in oceanic, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems (including agricultural  systems), would align well with the ongoing efforts to implement the multiple driver/multistressor framework in global change research”

The metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy in each fraction. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 was 93 ± 24 μg m−3.The total concentrations of Cr, Pb, Ni, Co, As and Cd in fine particle were 192 ± 54, 128 ± 25, 108 ± 34, 36 ± 6, 35 ± 5 and 8 ± 2 ng m−3, respectively. Results indicated that Cd and Co had the most bioavailability indexes. Risk Assessment Code and contamination factors were calculated to assess the environmental risk. The present study evaluated the potential Pb hazard to young children using the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model. From the model, the probability density of PbB (blood lead level) revealed that at the prevailing atmospheric concentration, 0.302 children are expected to have PbB concentrations exceeding 10 μg dL−1 and an estimated IQ (intelligence quotient) loss of 1.8 points. The predicted blood Pb levels belong to Group 3 (PbB {\textless} 5 μg dL−1). Based on the bioavailable fractions, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks via inhalation exposure were assessed for infants, toddlers, children, males and females. The hazard index for potential toxic metals was 2.50, which was higher than the safe limit (1). However, the combined carcinogenic risk for infants, toddlers, children, males and females was marginally higher than the precautionary criterion (10−6).},

	abstract = {African forest are increasingly in decline as a result of land-use conversion due to human activities. However, a consistent and detailed characterization and mapping of land-use change that results in forest loss is not available at the spatial-temporal resolution and thematic levels suitable for decision-making at the local and regional scales; so far they have only been provided on coarser scales and restricted to humid forests. Here we present the first high-resolution (5 m) and continental-scale mapping of land use following deforestation in Africa, which covers an estimated 13.85\% of the global forest area, including humid and dry forests. We use reference data for 15 different land-use types from 30 countries and implement an active learning framework to train a deep learning model for predicting land-use following deforestation with an F1-score of \$\$84{\textbackslash}pm 0.7\$\$for the whole of Africa. Our results show that the causes of forest loss vary by region. In general, small-scale cropland is the dominant driver of forest loss in Africa, with hotspots in Madagascar and DRC. In addition, commodity crops such as cacao, oil palm, and rubber are the dominant drivers of forest loss in the humid forests of western and central Africa, forming an “arc of commodity crops” in that region. At the same time, the hotspots for cashew are found to increasingly dominate in the dry forests of both western and south-eastern Africa, while larger hotspots for large-scale croplands were found in Nigeria and Zambia. The increased expansion of cacao, cashew, oil palm, rubber, and large-scale croplands observed in humid and dry forests of western and south-eastern Africa suggests they are vulnerable to future land-use changes by commodity crops, thus creating challenges for achieving the zero deforestation supply chains, support REDD+ initiatives, and towards sustainable development goals.},

	abstract = {Background: The dengue and chikungunya epidemics have major challenging problems and have become essentially a public health importance in India for the recent years, and it has been transmitted by the Aedes genus (Aedes aegypti or Ae. Albopictus) mosquito vectors. The huge chikungunya epidemic cases was reported in 213 districts especially in South India during 2006 and it happened in India, after 25 years period of breaks. The epidemic was showing good improvement of spatially declining trend, however, the dengue epidemics were reported from 24 states / union territories of India with 37070 cases and 227 deaths during 2012 and it steadily increased to become a very serious threat to the public. Materials and Methods: The ARC View 3.2 GIS was used for mapping the occurrences of epidemics situation in the country, geo-statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 10.0, and ERDAS Imagine 8.5 image processing software was used for calibrating the NDVI value from IRS WiFS data.
Results and discussion: The spatial analysis of geo-climate and the determinant variables with the epidemic cases provided results that temperature was experienced with a range of 22 to 31 oC, and relative humidity of 70 \% to 90 \%, and rain fall providing most suitable environment for fueling the huge number of profusion of Aedes mosquito species, with 95\% significant and 5 \% precision. Dengue and chikungunya epidemics in major metropolitan cities across the country, and rural areas in Maharashtra, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu have been associated with the huge number of containers of damaged house hold things in the coastal areas making it suitable for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes breeding. The regulation of irregular drinking water supply was supplied once in a week or 10 days, and hence, the village people have the practice of drinking water storage in big plastic container/ vessels and cement container, which was statistically significant with chi-square χ2 test, (P value {\textless}0.05). Chikungunya in Kerala was most associated with massive number of coconut shell used for collection of rubber milk in the rubber plantation in Kerala, and the massive pineapple cultivation in the state also fueling for dengue vector profusion in the state. The NDVI values of {\textless}0.4was due to the presence of actively photosynthesizing vegetation of rubber plantation, pineapple, forest cover, and hence, provided guidelines to stratification of areas under vulnerable to the dengue and chikungunya transmission.
Conclusion: Climate, landscape and environment play an important role and has influence on the epidemic transmission across the country. The application of remote sensing and GIS was potentially useful for stratification of transmission risk areas, and perhaps, useful for epidemic control and management in the country.},

	abstract = {During Malaysia’s rapid economic development into becoming a middle income country in the past several decades, environmental changes resulted in altered land use patterns because of agricultural practices such as large scale rice, rubber and oil palm cultivation. The impact of environmental changes brought about by rice and rubber cultivation affected the breeding habitats of mosquito vectors which in turn affected the prevalence of two strains of lymphatic filariasis in different ways. With scrub typhus, the development of oil palm plantations affected the ecology of mite and rodent populations which resulted in very high incidence of the disease in affected populations. Malaysia’s relentless urbanization has resulted in increased incidence of dengue, as peridomestic mosquito vectors increasingly colonize urban habitats. This article discusses how ecological factors determine the way lymphatic filariasis, scrub typhus and dengue were spread in Malaysia. The nation’s experience with environmental changes due to rapid development provides lessons for other developing countries in control programs and public health policy.},

The versatile adaptability of Ae. albopictus to switch over to breeding in plants poses a serious problem to control vector breeding, as source reduction of vector is the recognised strategy for the control of chikungunya fever. The present study indicated the preponderance of Ae. albopictus in the affected wards/districts of Kerala with chikungunya, resorting to breeding in containers and certain species of plants.


Methods:
Findings:


Ae. albopictus breeding was encountered in the leaf axils of many plants viz., pineapple (Ananas comosus), bromeliads (Guzmania spp), banana (Musa spp), screw pine (Pandanus odoratissimus) and in the primary rachis of coconut (Cocos nucifera). Breeding of Ae. albopictus in plants observed in the affected areas ranged from 7.7 to 70.4 per cent. Maximum Ae. albopictus breeding in plants were recorded in Thiruvananthapuram followed by Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Palakkad, Eranakulam, and Palakkad districts. Among the different plants, 80.8 per cent of breeding was observed in the leaf axils of pineapple, followed by flowering plants (7.8\%), 5 per cent each in screw pine and primary rachis of coconut palm trees and 1.45 per cent in banana plants.


A significant finding in the present investigation is the role of certain species of plants serving as an ideal habitat conducive for breeding of Ae. albopictus as has been reported from Thailand18. The present data indicated that pineapple plants support maximum breeding of Ae. albopictus, and Kerala has extensive pineapple plantations.

	abstract = {Incidence of dengue in Kottayam district, Kerala commences with cases reported from forest fringe areas of Kanjirappally every year. An entomological investigation was carried out to study the relative abundance of dengue vector and to delineate their breeding habitats in the forest fringe areas of Kanjirappally taluk. Four villages (Erumeli, Mundakayam, Kootikal, Koruthode) located in the forest fringe areas of Kanjirappally taluk have been selected for the study. In each study area all the breeding sources in and around 24 households covering an area of about 0.5 Sq Km were surveyed and checked for vector breeding at fortnightly intervals from February 2021 to October 2021. Immatures were collected from positive breeding site and were brought to the laboratory for emergence and species identification. Larval indices were calculated using WHO methods. Ae albopictus was found to be the most prevalent and widely distributed vector species and the primary vector Ae. aegypti was not found during the household survey. The maximum Container index and Breteau index were found to be 71.45 and 51.90 during the month of June and July which shows a linear positive correlation with rainfall and significantly higher pupal index was found during the month of May (2.96). Peridomestic water storage containers and rubber plantation associated containers were the main breeding habitat observed which accounts 64.08\% and 80.29\% of pupal production during the dry and wet seasons respectively. Sylvan environment of rubber plantation together with favourable climatic conditions are the key factors for the prevalence of dengue vector in the forest fringe areas of Kerala. 1. Introduction Dengue is caused by virus belonging to family flaviviridae and having four serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Dengue infection ranged from simple fever to much more severe and sometimes fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1]. According to WHO about 40\% of the world's population are now at risk of dengue and among all the WHO regions, the Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions contribute nearly 75\% of the global burden of dengue [2]. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the major vectors for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Before 1990, dengue was not widespread in India. The first case was reported in 1996 in the rural areas of Haryana state followed by several outbreaks in different parts of the country [3]. In recent years the number of dengue cases has increased tremendously all over India and almost all states are endemic for dengue [4, 5]. A study done by Oxford university on global distribution and burden of dengue estimates that India alone contribute 34\% (33 million infections) of global total and 100 million asymptomatic cases occurring annually [6]. With an area of only about 1.5\% of the country and about 2.8\% of the population, Kerala state reported more than 13.1\% of dengue cases in India for the last seven years. Dengue virus was detected in wild caught Aedes albopictus around Kozhikode airport of Malappuram District, Kerala [7]. Also the detection of virus from field collected adult male and female Ae. albopictus [8] suggest evidence for vertical transmission of dengue virus in Kerala. All four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, were found to be prevalent in the state [9]. For the past ten years dengue cases with varying degree of severity have been},

1. The analysis of causation should begin with studying the effects of causes rather than the traditional approach of trying to define what the cause of a given effect is. 2. Effects of causes are always relative to other causes (i.e., it takes two causes to define an effect). 3. Not everything can be a cause; in particular, attributes of units are never causes


models for causal inference are distinctly different than those for associational inferences


emphasis on the effects of causes VS the causes of effects


the role of time in assoication inference is simply to affect the definitino of the population of units or specify the operatin meaning of a variable
for causal inference, time has a greater meaning

Rubin’s model


“This is the fact that the effect of a cause is always relative to another cause. For example, the phrase “A causes B” almost always means that A causes B relative to some other cause that includes the condition “not A.”


For causal inference, it is critical that each unit be potentially  exposable to any one of the causes.


The role of a response variable Y is to measure the effect of the cause, and thus response variables must fall into the post-exposure class.


It says that treatment t causes the effect Y,(u) - Y,(u) on unit U (relative to treatment c) or more simply that t causes the effect Y,(u) - Y,(u)


It is impossible to observe the value of Y,(u) and Yc(u) on the same unit and, therefore, it  is  impossible to observe the effect of t on u
T defined as the average causal effect. By the usual rules of probability but may also be expressed as T = E(Y,) - E(Y,)
Associational inference involves the joint or conditional distributions of values of Y and A, and causal inference concerns the values Y,(u) - Y,(u) on individual units. 

special cases of causal inference:


assume that (a) the value of Yc(u) does  not  depend on when the se- quence “apply c to u then measure Yon u” occurs and (b) the value of Y,(u) is not affected by the prior exposure of u to the sequence in (a). 


The first assumption is temporal stability, because it asserts the constancy of  response over time. 


The second  assumption is causal transience, because it  asserts that the effect of the cause c and the measurement process that results  in  Yc(u) is  transient  and does not change u enough to affect Y,(u) measured later.


 that Yf(ul) = Y,(u,) and Y,(ul) = Yc(u,) for two units u1 and u2. This is  the assumption of unit homogeneity - “scientists prepare units to look identical in all relevant  aspects.”


 an assumption that, if plausible, makes these two expected values equal.  It is the assumption of independence.


 assumption of constant effect is that the effect of t on every unit is the same, and under this  assumption we have the equation -{\textgreater} Hence  under the assumption of constant  effect T is the causal effect for every unit  in U. This assumption is  also called additivity in statistical models for experiments be- cause the treatment t  adds a  constant amount T to  the control remonse for each unit.




Hume + causal inference
three basic criteria for cau- sation: (a) spatial/temporal contiguity, (b)   temporal succession, and (c) constant  conjunction.

An attribute cannot be a cause in an experiment, because the notion of potential exposability does  not  apply to it. The general problem, I think, is in deciding when some- thing is an attribute of units and when it is a came that can act on units. In the former  case all that can be discussed is  association, whereas in the latter case it is  possible, at least, to contemplate measuring causal effects

Payments are given to private landowners who own land in forest areas in recognition of the ecosystem services their land provides. To characterize the distribution of PSA in Costa Rica, we combined remote sensing with geographic information system databases and then used econometrics to explore the impacts of payments on deforestation. Payments were distributed broadly across ecological and socioeconomic gradients, but the 1997–2000 deforestation rate was not significantly lower in areas that received payments. Other successful Costa Rican conservation policies, including those prior to the PSA program, may explain the current reduction in deforestation rates. The PSA program is a major advance in the global institutionalization of ecosystem investments because few, if any, other countries have such a conservation history and because much can be learned from Costa Rica's experiences.},

Evidence-based policy-making has become a recurring theme in public policy, alongside greater demands for accountability in public policies and public spending, and requests for independent and rigorous impact evaluations for policy evidence. Frölich and Sperlich offer a comprehensive and up-to-date approach to quantitative impact evaluation analysis, also known as causal inference or treatment effect analysis, illustrating the main approaches for identification and estimation: experimental studies, randomization inference and randomized control trials (RCTs), matching and propensity score matching and weighting, instrumental variable estimation, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity designs, quantile treatment effects, and evaluation of dynamic treatments. The book is designed for economics graduate courses but can also serve as a manual for professionals in research institutes, governments, and international organizations, evaluating the impact of a wide range of public policies in health, environment},

Four identification strategies are discussed, and five empirical examples – the effects of schooling, unions, immigration, military service, and class size – illustrate the methodological points. In discussing each example, we adopt an experimentalist perspective that emphasizes the distinction between variables that have causal effects, control variables, and outcome variables. The chapter also discusses secondary datasets, primary data collection strategies, and administrative data. The section on measurement issues focuses on recent empirical examples, presents a summary of empirical findings on the reliability of key labor market data, and briefly reviews the role of survey sampling weights and the allocation of missing values in empirical research. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the effect of the 2009 Station Fire in the Angeles National Forest northeast of Los Angeles, CA on trace element concentrations in streams, and 2) compare trace elements in post-fire stormflow water quality to criteria for aquatic life to determine if trace elements reached concentrations that can harm aquatic life. Pre-storm and stormflow water-quality samples were collected in streams located inside and outside of the burn area of the Station Fire. Ash and burned soil samples were collected from several locations within the perimeter of the Station Fire. Filtered concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Hg and total concentrations of most trace elements in storm samples were elevated as a result of the Station Fire. In contrast, filtered concentrations of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Se and total concentrations of Cu were elevated primarily due to storms and not the Station Fire. Total concentrations of Se and Zn were elevated as a result of both storms and the Station Fire. Suspended sediment in stormflows following the Station Fire was an important transport mechanism for trace elements. Cu, Pb, and Zn primarily originate from ash in the suspended sediment. Fe primarily originates from burned soil in the suspended sediment. As, Mn, and Ni originate from both ash and burned soil. Filtered concentrations of trace elements in stormwater samples affected by the Station Fire did not reach levels that were greater than criteria established for aquatic life. Total concentrations for Fe, Pb, Ni, and Zn were detected at concentrations above criteria established for aquatic life.},

	abstract = {Dengue fever is a vector-borne disease affecting millions yearly, mostly in tropical and subtropical countries. Driven mainly by social and environmental factors, dengue incidence and geographical expansion have increased in recent decades. Therefore, understanding how climate variables drive dengue outbreaks is challenging and a problem of interest for decision-makers that could aid in improving surveillance and resource allocation. Here, we explore the effect of climate variables on relative dengue risk in 32 cantons of interest for public health authorities in Costa Rica. Relative dengue risk is forecast using a Generalized Additive Model for location, scale, and shape and a Random Forest approach. Models use a training period from 2000 to 2020 and predicted climatic variables obtained with a vector auto-regressive model. Results show reliable projections, and climate variables predictions allow for a prospective instead of a retrospective study., Dengue fever is a vector-borne viral disease endemic to tropical and subtropical countries. The virus is transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes and affects approximately 100 million people every year. Although most infections are mild or asymptomatic, some may cause severe symptoms, leading to a higher risk of death. In the affected countries, the challenges associated with preventing and controlling dengue outbreaks have highlighted the need for novel tools. In this context, using statistical tools with climate and epidemiological information makes it possible to provide timely information to public health officials about the risk of dengue outbreaks, allowing the optimization of resources and preventive and non-reactive decision-making.},

The objectives included identifying and quantifying wildfire composition, smoke evolution, and climate and health impacts of wildfires and agricultural fires in the United States. Ground based mobile sampling via sorbent tubes occurred at the Nethker and Williams Flats fires (2019) and Chief Timothy and Whitetail Loop fires (2020) in Idaho and Washington. Air samples were analyzed through thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for a variety of volatile organic compounds to elucidate both composition and health impacts. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, butenes, phenol, isoprene and pinenes were observed in the wildfire smoke, with benzene ranging from 0.04 to 25 ppbv. Health risk was assessed for each fire by determining sub-chronic (wildfire event) and projected chronic inhalation risk exposure from benzene, a carcinogen, as well as other non-carcinogenic compounds including toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and hexane. The cancer risk of benzene from sub-chronic exposure was 1 extra cancer per million people and ranged from 1 to 19 extra cancers per million people for the projected chronic scenarios, compared to a background level of 1 extra cancer per million people. The hazard index of non-carcinogenic compounds was less than one for all scenarios and wildfires sampled, which was considered low risk for non-cancer health events.},

However, recent trends in PM2.5 concentrations, a key pollutant, have stagnated or begun to reverse throughout much of the US. We quantify the contribution of wildfire smoke to these trends and find that since 2016, wildfire smoke has significantly slowed or reversed previous improvements in average annual PM2.5 concentrations in two-thirds of US states, eroding 23\% of previous gains on average in those states (equivalent to 3.6 years of air quality progress) and over 50\% in multiple western states. Smoke influence on trends in extreme PM2.5 concentrations is detectable by 2010 and is concentrated in a dozen western states. Wildfire-driven increases in ambient PM2.5 concentrations are unregulated under current air pollution law, and, absent additional intervention, wildfire's contribution to regional and national air quality trends is likely to grow as the climate continues to warm.},

Formally, clustered standard errors adjust for the correlations induced by sampling the outcome variable from a data-generating process with unobserved cluster-level components. However, the standard econometric framework for clustering leaves important questions unanswered: (i) Why do we adjust standard errors for clustering in some ways but not others, for example, by state but not by gender, and in observational studies but not in completely randomized experiments? (ii) Is the clustered variance estimator valid if we observe a large fraction of the clusters in the population? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these and other questions using a novel framework for clustered inference on average treatment effects. In addition to the common sampling component, the new framework incorporates a design component that accounts for the variability induced on the estimator by the treatment assignment mechanism. We show that, when the number of clusters in the sample is a nonnegligible fraction of the number of clusters in the population, conventional clustered standard errors can be severely inflated, and propose new variance estimators that correct for this bias.},

need for clustering depends on a nonzero correlation bw residuals for units belonging to same cluster --{\textgreater} the presence of this correlation does not necessitate clustering


no harm in using clustering adjustments when they are not required



when should standard errors be clustered, and at what level?

Its presence among the indigenous population of Peninsular Malaysia (Orang Asli), however, has not been well described. The present study was performed to investigate the seroprevalence of dengue among the Orang Asli (OA) residing at the forest fringe areas of Peninsular Malaysia and determine the factors that could affect the transmission of dengue among the OA. Eight OA communities consisting of 491 individuals were recruited. From the study, at least 17\% of the recruited study participants were positive for dengue IgG, indicating past exposure to dengue. Analysis on the demographic and socioeconomic variables suggested that high seroprevalence of dengue was significantly associated with those above 13 years old and a low household income of less than MYR500 (USD150). It was also associated with the vast presence of residential areas and the presence of a lake. Remote sensing analysis showed that higher land surface temperatures and lower land elevations also contributed to higher dengue seroprevalence. The present study suggested that both demographic and geographical factors contributed to the increasing risk of contracting dengue among the OA living at the forest fringe areas of Peninsular Malaysia. The OA, hence, remained vulnerable to dengue.},

This ancestral sylvatic–DENV transmission cycle still exists and is maintained in non-human primates and Aedes mosquitoes in the forests of Southeast Asia and West Africa. Here, we provide an overview of the ecology and molecular evolution of sylvatic DENV and its potential for adaptation to human transmission.

The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2\% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1\% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land.

	abstract = {Zoonotic diseases represent 75\% of emerging infectious diseases worldwide, and their emergence is mainly attributed to human-driven changes in landscapes. Land use change, especially the conversion of natural areas to agricultural use, has the potential to impact hosts and vector dynamics, affecting pathogen transmission risk. While these links are becoming better understood, very few studies have investigated the opposite question—how native vegetation restoration affects zoonotic disease outbreaks. We reviewed the existing evidence linking native vegetation restoration with zoonotic transmission risk, identified knowledge gaps, and, by focusing on tropical areas, proposed forest restoration strategies that could help in limiting the spread of zoonotic diseases. We identified a large gap in information on the effects of native vegetation restoration on zoonotic diseases, especially within tropical regions. In addition, the few studies that exist do not consider environmental aspects that can affect the outcomes of restoration on disease risk, such as the land use history and landscape structural characteristics (as composition and configuration of native habitats). Our conceptual framework raises two important points: (1) the effects of forest restoration may depend on the context of the existing landscape, especially the percentage of native vegetation existing at the beginning of the restoration; and (2) these effects will also be dependent on the spatial arrangement of the restored area within the existing landscape. Furthermore, we propose important topics to be studied in the coming years to integrate zoonotic disease risk as a criterion in restoration planning. Synthesis and application. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive forest restoration planning, comprising multiple ecosystem services and resulting in healthier landscapes for both people and nature. Our framework could be integrated into the post-2020 global biodiversity framework targets.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) threaten over 80\% of the world’s population, and are increasing in intensity and shifting in geographical range with land use and climate change. Mitigation hinges on understanding disease-specific risk profiles, but current risk maps are severely limited in spatial resolution. One important determinant of MBD risk is temperature, and though the relationships between temperature and risk have been extensively studied, maps are often created using sparse data that fail to capture microclimatic conditions. Here, we leverage high resolution land surface temperature (LST) measurements, in conjunction with established relationships between air temperature and MBD risk factors like mosquito biting rate and transmission probability, to produce fine resolution (70 m) maps of MBD risk components. We focus our case study on West Nile virus (WNV) in the San Joaquin Valley of California, where temperatures vary widely across the day and the diverse agricultural/urban landscape. We first use field measurements to establish a relationship between LST and air temperature, and apply it to Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment data (2018–2020) in peak WNV transmission months (June–September). We then use the previously derived equations to estimate spatially explicit mosquito biting and WNV transmission rates. We use these maps to uncover significant differences in risk across land cover types, and identify the times of day which contribute to high risk for different land covers. Additionally, we evaluate the value of high resolution spatial and temporal data in avoiding biased risk estimates due to Jensen’s inequality, and find that using aggregate data leads to significant biases of up to 40.5\% in the possible range of risk values. Through this analysis, we show that the synergy between novel remote sensing technology and fundamental principles of disease ecology can unlock new insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of MBDs.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear—a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5\%, total abundance by 39.5\% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3\%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6\%), total abundance (10.7\%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1\%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4\% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9\% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.},

From a total of 523 identified studies, 29 were included in the analysis. Studies were categorised into 2 main subgroups, namely “Aedes ecology” and “transmission dynamics” according to the main influence factors posed by urbanisation. Selected articles showed a clear relationship of urbanisation with distribution and density of Aedes mosquitoes and a robust association between vector production, human population density, and disease transmission. Differing definitions of ’urbanisation’ and the interplay of numerous factors linking urbanisation with ecological, entomological, and epidemiological parameters highlight the need for a multidimensional perspective when assessing the impacts of rapid and unplanned urban expansion and when designing effective control programmes.},

Here, we present results from a 80-week longitudinal study where Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) ovitraps were monitored weekly at 92 locations in Puntarenas, a coastal city in Costa Rica with syndemic Zika, chikungunya and dengue transmission. We used separate models to investigate the association of either Ae. aegypti-borne arboviral cases or Ae. aegypti egg counts with remotely sensed environmental variables. We also evaluated whether Ae. aegypti-borne arboviral cases were associated with Ae. aegypti egg counts. Using cross-correlation and time series modeling, we found that arboviral cases were not significantly associated with Ae. aegypti egg counts. Through model selection we found that cases had a non-linear response to multi-scale (1-km and 30-m resolution) measurements of temperature standard deviation (SD) with a lag of up to 4 weeks, while simultaneously increasing with finely-grained NDVI (30-m resolution). Meanwhile, median ovitrap Ae. aegypti egg counts increased, and respectively decreased, with temperature SD (1-km resolution) and EVI (30-m resolution) with a lag of 6 weeks. A synchrony analysis showed that egg counts had a travelling wave pattern, with synchrony showing cyclic changes with distance, a pattern not observed in remotely sensed data with 30-m and 10-m resolution. Spatially, using generalized additive models, we found that eggs were more abundant at locations with higher temperatures and where EVI was leptokurtic during the study period. Our results suggest that, in Puntarenas, remotely sensed environmental variables are associated with both Ae. aegypti-borne arbovirus transmission and Ae. aegypti egg counts from ovitraps.},

We examine the nature and size of water pollution externalities as rivers flow across jurisdictions. Panel data on water pollution in Brazilian rivers coupled with county splits that change the locations of borders allow us to identify the spatial patterns of pollution as rivers approach and cross borders, controlling for fixed effects and trends specific to each location. The theory of externalities predicts that pollution should increase at an increasing rate as the river approaches the downstream exit border, that there should be a structural break in the slope of the pollution function at the border, and that a larger number of managing jurisdictions should exacerbate pollution externalities. We find support for all four predictions in the data. Satellite data on growth in night-time lights along rivers show that local authorities allow more settlements to develop close to rivers in the downstream portions of counties, which is the likely underlying mechanism. The border effects on pollution are not as pronounced when the cost of inter-jurisdictional coordination is lower.},

	abstract = {Deforestation and land use change are among the most pressing anthropogenic environmental impacts. In Brazil, a resurgence of malaria in recent decades paralleled rapid deforestation and settlement in the Amazon basin, yet evidence of a deforestation-driven increase in malaria remains equivocal. We hypothesize an underlying cause of this ambiguity is that deforestation and malaria influence each other in bidirectional causal relationships-deforestation increases malaria through ecological mechanisms and malaria reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms-and that the strength of these relationships depends on the stage of land use transformation. We test these hypotheses with a large geospatial dataset encompassing 795 municipalities across 13 y (2003 to 2015) and show deforestation has a strong positive effect on malaria incidence. Our results suggest a 10\% increase in deforestation leads to a 3.3\% increase in malaria incidence (∼9,980 additional cases associated with 1,567 additional km2 lost in 2008, the study midpoint, Amazon-wide). The effect is larger in the interior and absent in outer Amazonian states where little forest remains. However, this strong effect is only detectable after controlling for a feedback of malaria burden on forest loss, whereby increased malaria burden significantly reduces forest clearing, possibly mediated by human behavior or economic development. We estimate a 1\% increase in malaria incidence results in a 1.4\% decrease in forest area cleared (∼219 fewer km2 cleared associated with 3,024 additional cases in 2008). This bidirectional socioecological feedback between deforestation and malaria, which attenuates as land use intensifies, illustrates the intimate ties between environmental change and human health.},

	abstract = {Globalization has affected the reemergence of infectious diseases, with increased human travel and trade facilitating the introduction of diseases into new areas and the resurgence of diseases that had been eliminated in some places (1). However, the increased availability of scientific information from various research groups can help in the development of new and improved disease control measures. The combination of scientific research and reliable field assessments that consider different areas of knowledge and different geographic locations (world regions, countries, and communities) is essential for building greater understanding. This combination can also provide evidence that guides prevention and control measures at the local, national, regional, and global levels. 
Dengue is a reemerging and uncontrolled disease. With dengue, there is a need for more scientific research on the local factors that affect the disease system and the relationships among those factors. There is also a need to develop new or improved dengue control approaches (2). In this paper, the situation of scientific research on dengue is analyzed for the developing country of Costa Rica. Although dengue has become the most important vector-borne disease in Costa Rica over the last decade, published scientific research dealing with the local situation is scarce (3). This could be due to various factors such as the historical and political context and limited financial and human resources. Filling this gap in Costa Rica and other developing countries would benefit local control programs and help efforts around the world to develop best practices for dengue prevention and control. Making this new knowledge broadly available could help improve the global dengue situation.},

	abstract = {Background
Dengue is the most common arbovirus infection globally, but its burden is poorly quantified. We estimated dengue mortality, incidence, and burden for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.
Methods
We modelled mortality from vital registration, verbal autopsy, and surveillance data using the Cause of Death Ensemble Modelling tool. We modelled incidence from officially reported cases, and adjusted our raw estimates for under-reporting based on published estimates of expansion factors. In total, we had 1780 country-years of mortality data from 130 countries, 1636 country-years of dengue case reports from 76 countries, and expansion factor estimates for 14 countries.
Findings
We estimated an average of 9221 dengue deaths per year between 1990 and 2013, increasing from a low of 8277 (95\% uncertainty estimate 5353–10 649) in 1992, to a peak of 11 302 (6790–13 722) in 2010. This yielded a total of 576 900 (330 000–701 200) years of life lost to premature mortality attributable to dengue in 2013. The incidence of dengue increased greatly between 1990 and 2013, with the number of cases more than doubling every decade, from 8·3 million (3·3 million–17·2 million) apparent cases in 1990, to 58·4 million (23·6 million–121·9 million) apparent cases in 2013. When accounting for disability from moderate and severe acute dengue, and post-dengue chronic fatigue, 566 000 (186 000–1 415 000) years lived with disability were attributable to dengue in 2013. Considering fatal and non-fatal outcomes together, dengue was responsible for 1·14 million (0·73 million–1·98 million) disability-adjusted life-years in 2013.
Interpretation
Although lower than other estimates, our results offer more evidence that the true symptomatic incidence of dengue probably falls within the commonly cited range of 50 million to 100 million cases per year. Our mortality estimates are lower than those presented elsewhere and should be considered in light of the totality of evidence suggesting that dengue mortality might, in fact, be substantially higher.

	abstract = {Background: Dengue is a growing problem both in its geographical spread and in its intensity, and yet current global distribution remains highly uncertain. Challenges in diagnosis and diagnostic methods as well as highly variable national health systems mean no single data source can reliably estimate the distribution of this disease. As such, there is a lack of agreement on national dengue status among international health organisations. Here we bring together all available information on dengue occurrence using a novel approach to produce an evidence consensus map of the disease range that highlights nations with an uncertain dengue status.
Methods/Principal Findings: A baseline methodology was used to assess a range of evidence for each country. In regions where dengue status was uncertain, additional evidence types were included to either clarify dengue status or confirm that it is unknown at this time. An algorithm was developed that assesses evidence quality and consistency, giving each country an evidence consensus score. Using this approach, we were able to generate a contemporary global map of national-level dengue status that assigns a relative measure of certainty and identifies gaps in the available evidence.
Conclusion: The map produced here provides a list of 128 countries for which there is good evidence of dengue occurrence, including 36 countries that have previously been classified as dengue-free by the World Health Organization and/or the US Centers for Disease Control. It also identifies disease surveillance needs, which we list in full. The disease extents and limits determined here using evidence consensus, marks the beginning of a five-year study to advance the mapping of dengue virus transmission and disease risk. Completion of this first step has allowed us to produce a preliminary estimate of population at risk with an upper bound of 3.97 billion people. This figure will be refined in future work.},

Here, we explore the effect of climate variables on relative dengue risk in 32 cantons of interest for public health authorities in Costa Rica. Relative dengue risk is forecast using a Generalized Additive Model for location, scale, and shape and a Random Forest approach. Models use a training period from 2000 to 2020 and predicted climatic variables obtained with a vector auto-regressive model. Results show reliable projections, and climate variables predictions allow for a prospective instead of a retrospective study.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) such as malaria, dengue, and Rift Valley fever threaten public health and food security globally. Despite their cohesive nature, they are typically treated as distinct entities. Applying biological system analysis to the African MBDs from a One Health perspective, we provide the first biogeographic description of the African mosquito fauna corresponding with the pathogens they transmit. After compiling records accumulated over a century, we find that there are 677 mosquito species in Africa, representing 16 genera, and 151 mosquito-borne pathogens (MBPs) circulating primarily among wild tetrapods, dominated by viruses (95) and protozoans (47). We estimate that reported MBPs represent ∼1\% of the actual number. Unlike mosquitoes, African arboviruses and mammalian plasmodia represent a higher share of the World’s total based on the area – species richness relationship (P{\textless}0.0001), explaining the disproportional large share of global MBPs that originated from Africa. Species richness of African mosquitoes and MBPs are similarly concentrated along the equator, peaking in central Africa, with a secondary “ridge” along eastern Africa. Moderate diversity and low endemicity in mosquitoes across the Sahel reveals a fauna with high propensity for long-range migration. Regional differences in species richness, endemicity, and composition agreed with country-based results. The composition of mosquitoes and MBPs separates sub-Saharan Africa from north Africa, in accordance with the Palearctic and Afrotropical faunal realms, and west and central Africa are clustered together distinctly from the cluster of eastern and southern Africa. With ∼25\% of the species occupying a single country, ∼50\% in 1–3 countries and {\textless}5\% found in {\textgreater}25 countries, the typical ranges of both mosquitoes and MBPs are surprisingly small. The striking similarity in diversity and especially in range distributions of mosquitoes and MBPs suggest that most MBPs are transmitted by one or few narrow-range mosquito vectors. Exceptionally widespread mosquito species (e.g., Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and 10 Anopheles species) feed preferentially on people and domestic animals, and nearly half are windborne migrants. Likewise, exceptionally widespread MBPs are transmitted between people or domestic animals and are vectored by one or more of the aforementioned widespread mosquitoes. Our results suggest that few MBPs have undergone a dramatic range expansion, after adapting to people or domestic animals as well as to exceptionally-widespread mosquitoes. During the intermediate phase of range expansion, MBPs extend their vector and vertebrate host ranges with a concomitant gradual increase in geographical range. Because range size may serve as a marker of the phase of range expansion, ranking the African MBPs according to range, we identified several MBPs that pose elevated risk for disease emergence (e.g., Wesselsbron virus). Taken together, our database, approach, and results can help improve MBD surveillance and lead to a better understanding of disease emergence. This knowledge has the potential to improve capacity to prevent and mitigate new and emerging MBD threats.},

	abstract = {Aim The idea of combining predictions from different models into an ensemble has gained considerable popularity in species distribution modelling, partly due to free and comprehensive software such as the R package BIOMOD. However, despite proliferation of ensemble models, we lack oversight of how and where they are used for modelling distributions, and how well they perform. Here, we present such an overview. Location Global. Methods Since BIOMOD is freely available and widely used by ensemble species distribution modellers, we focused on articles that apply BIOMOD, filtering the initial 852 papers identified in our structured literature search to a relevant final subset of 224 eligible peer-reviewed journal articles. Results BIOMOD-based ensembles are used across many taxa and locations, with terrestrial plants being the most represented group of species (n = 72) and Europe being the most represented continent (n = 106). These studies often focus on forecasting distributions in the future (n = 109), and commonly use presence-only species data (n = 139) and climatic environmental predictors (n = 219). An average of six models are used in ensembles, and approximately half of ensembles weight contributions of models by their cross-validation performance. However, discussion about choices made in the modelling process and unambiguous information on the performance of ensemble models versus individual models are limited. The use of independent data to validate model performance is particularly uncommon. Main conclusions We document the breadth of ensemble applications, but could not draw strong quantitative conclusions about the predictive performance of ensemble models, due to lack of unambiguous information reported. Understanding how and where ensembles are best used when modelling species distributions is important for enabling best choices for different applications. To enable this objective to be achieved, we provide recommendations for thorough reporting practices in a BIOMOD-based ensemble workflow.},

	abstract = {Auxiliary information in the form of species abundance is frequently available as part of data collected for ecological investigations, yet when modeling distributions of species over large regions, species presence (and sometimes absence) are typically used. Incorporating abundances into species distribution models may greatly improve model predictive accuracy in practice. Boosted regression trees (BRT) models have been widely used in species distribution modeling, however no ecological study has been conducted to date that has assessed the predictive accuracy of BRT models that incorporates species abundance weights. We compared traditional, unweighted BRTs with species abundance-weighted BRTs for 55 fluvial fish species native to the Northeastern U.S. Overall model deviance explained and six diagnostic measures of predictive performance were compared between traditional BRTs and weighted BRTs. These comparisons indicated that unweighted BRTs performed better for fluvial fish species considered common, including those with greater numbers of presences and higher prevalence. Conversely, weighted BRTs were better suited for modeling distributions of species that had fewer presences, lower prevalence, and higher rarity, indicating the potential of species abundance-weighted distribution modeling to improve results for species of high conservation importance. Last, we offer insights into the applicability of using weighted approaches with other commonly used species distribution modeling methods.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the potential for using seasonal climate forecasts in developing an early warning system for dengue fever epidemics in Brazil. In the first instance, a generalised linear model (GLM) is used to select climate and other covariates which are both readily available and prove significant in prediction of confirmed monthly dengue cases based on data collected across the whole of Brazil for the period January 2001 to December 2008 at the microregion level (typically consisting of one large city and several smaller municipalities). The covariates explored include temperature and precipitation data on a 2.5°×2.5° longitude–latitude grid with time lags relevant to dengue transmission, an El Niño Southern Oscillation index and other relevant socio-economic and environmental variables. A negative binomial model formulation is adopted in this model selection to allow for extra-Poisson variation (overdispersion) in the observed dengue counts caused by unknown/unobserved confounding factors and possible correlations in these effects in both time and space. Subsequently, the selected global model is refined in the context of the South East region of Brazil, where dengue predominates, by reverting to a Poisson framework and explicitly modelling the overdispersion through a combination of unstructured and spatio-temporal structured random effects. The resulting spatio-temporal hierarchical model (or GLMM—generalised linear mixed model) is implemented via a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Dengue predictions are found to be enhanced both spatially and temporally when using the GLMM and the Bayesian framework allows posterior predictive distributions for dengue cases to be derived, which can be useful for developing a dengue alert system. Using this model, we conclude that seasonal climate forecasts could have potential value in helping to predict dengue incidence months in advance of an epidemic in South East Brazil.},

Control of Aedes aegypti populations through source reduction is still considered the most effective way of prevention and control, although it has proven ineffective or unsustainable in many areas with a history of mosquito control. In this study, seasonal profiles and productivity of Aedes aegypti were analyzed in the city of Puntarenas, Costa Rica, where vector control has been practiced for more than ten years. Households contained more than 80\% of larval habitats identified, although presence of habitats was more likely in other locations like lots and streets. In the wet season, habitats in the “other” category, like appliances, small manholes, and miscellaneous containers, were the most frequent habitats observed as well as the most common and productive habitats for Ae. aegypti. In the dry season, domestic animal drinking containers were very common, although concrete washtubs contained 79\% of Ae. aegypti pupae collected. Individually, non-disposable habitats were as likely or more likely to contain mosquito larvae, and large containers were more likely to harbor mosquito larvae than the small ones only in the dry season. Considering various variables in the logistic regressions, predictors for Ae. aegypti in a habitat were habitat type (p{\textless}0.001), setting (p=0.043), and disposability (p=0.022) in the wet season and habitat capacity in the dry season (p=0.025). Overall, traditional Ae. aegypti larval indices and pupal indices in Puntarenas were high enough to allow viral transmission during the wet season. In spite of continued vector control, it has not been possible to reduce vector densities below threshold levels in Puntarenas, and the habitat profiles show that non-household locations, as well as non-disposable containers, should be targeted in addition to the standard control activities.},

It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. An attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. Large extent of water bodies, low land and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. Inappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. The protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is implicated in dengue transmission in tropical and subtropical urban areas around the world. Ae. aegypti populations are controlled through integrative vector management. However, the efficacy of vector control may be undermined by the presence of alternative, competent species. In Puerto Rico, a native mosquito, Ae. mediovittatus, is a competent dengue vector in laboratory settings and spatially overlaps with Ae. aegypti. It has been proposed that Ae. mediovittatus may act as a dengue reservoir during inter-epidemic periods, perpetuating endemic dengue transmission in rural Puerto Rico. Dengue transmission dynamics may therefore be influenced by the spatial overlap of Ae. mediovittatus, Ae. aegypti, dengue viruses, and humans. We take a landscape epidemiology approach to examine the association between landscape composition and configuration and the distribution of each of these Aedes species and their co-occurrence. We used remotely sensed imagery from a newly launched satellite to map landscape features at very high spatial resolution. We found that the distribution of Ae. aegypti is positively predicted by urban density and by the number of tree patches, Ae. mediovittatus is positively predicted by the number of tree patches, but negatively predicted by large contiguous urban areas, and both species are predicted by urban density and the number of tree patches. This analysis provides evidence that landscape composition and configuration is a surrogate for mosquito community composition, and suggests that mapping landscape structure can be used to inform vector control efforts as well as to inform urban planning.},

Hard and soft image classification algorithms were used to generate these variables, which were analysed with respect to vector habitat distribution as measured by the potential mosquito habitats during the wet season of 2006. A multiple linear regression model revealed that built-up surfaces derived from ASTER imagery explained 63.6\% of the variance in the number of larval habitats found during the wet season when transmission and incidence of dengue were highest. The results suggest that elements of urban structure such as built-up surfaces may be used to predict the presence of an important disease vector within urban areas and that medium-resolution satellite imagery may help to inform future prevention and control strategies in Costa Rica and other countries where dengue fever is endemic.},

          Approximately 3.9 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue fever, a group of viruses transmitted by mosquitos.1,2 In 2019 Central America has suffered a strong dengue epidemic.3 Costa Rica has almost doubled the number of dengue cases between in the first 24 epidemilogical weeks of 2019 regarding the same period in the previous year.4 In the Americas, forest cover is thought to diminish anthropogenic habitats for mosquito larvae, as well as increase the presence of their predators.5,6 Here we estimate the marginal effects of increasing forest cover on dengue prevalence, using econometric models to relate hospital admission records and forest cover maps from 2001 and 2011. We find that increasing the percentage of forest cover significantly decreased both the number of hospital admissions for dengue and the probability of an outbreak. Using the same models, we predict that increasing forest cover by one percentage point would have avoided between 85 to 103 dengue hospital admissions per year. This represents savings between USD 21,500 to 295,000 per year, depending on the severity of dengue cases. Our study shows that forest conservation can be a public health investment that increases welfare both by avoiding sickness and by reducing associated health care expenditures.

	abstract = {Background
Ecosystems are being degraded worldwide, reducing biodiversity and threatening human well-being. Especially in developing countries, rural and poor households often depend closely on natural capital for their livelihoods and health. However, the health consequences of ecosystem declines remain difficult to predict. Here, we report on two multicountry analysis to investigate general relationships between ecosystems and human health for these vulnerable populations.
Methods
We compiled a unique dataset covering about 300 000 children from more than 35 countries, by combining Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) with additional information about socioeconomic, climate, and environmental factors. We first examined the relationship between watershed conditions and diarrhoeal disease, a major cause of child malnutrition and mortality worldwide. In a second analysis, we then related forest cover more broadly to three health outcomes: diarrhoea, stunting, and anaemia. For both analyses, we used nested mixed-effects logit models to predict the probability of disease based on environmental variables as well as covariates representing climate, sanitation, education, and wealth.
Findings
In the first analysis, we find that more human activity upstream increases the probability of reported diarrhoea (model coefficient 0·10 [standard error (SE) 0·02]), and that higher tree cover upstream reduces it (–0·13 [0·04]). These effects are statistically significant for rural households (human activity: 0·11 [SE 0·03]; tree cover: −0·17 [0·05]), but not urban households (human activity: 0·07 [SE 0·04]; tree cover: −0·07 [0·06]), suggesting shifting dependences from natural to built capital. In the second analysis, we find that increased forest cover reduced the probabilities of all three diseases for the poorest segment of the population, but not for the wealthiest, again indicating differential dependencies on nature.
Interpretation
These analyses provide evidence that intact ecosystems are associated with improved child health outcomes, especially for the most vulnerable populations. Under certain conditions, therefore, efforts to protect and restore ecosystems could be considered an important public health investment.

	abstract = {Despite the considerable scholarship focused on infrastructure investment in the developing world and the substantial sums of money spent each year on developing-country infrastructure, little attention has been given to understanding the drivers of conflict that shape the trajectory and cost structures of these massive investments. The manifestation of conflict among stakeholders in infrastructure projects ranges from the renegotiation of contract terms by project partners to popular protests among consumers of privatized services. The principal objective of this research is to identify combinations of country, project, and stakeholder factors that are associated with the emergence of legal and political conflict within natural gas and oil pipeline projects and water supply concessions and leases. The analysis includes data from 26 infrastructure projects spanning 31 countries and uses an analytical approach derived from Boolean algebra. Country-level characteristics, such as extent of democracy and rate of international NGO membership, are found to be important elements in the recipes for conflict among water supply projects but not for pipeline projects. Local impacts such as service price increases (water supply) and limited provision of oil and gas to the project host country (pipelines) are also important drivers of conflict for both subsectors. The involvement of one or more international financial institutions is also associated with the emergence of conflict in projects. Contrary to expectations, public consultation is associated with conflict in both subsectors. Overall, the study findings suggest that several factors associated with conflict in infrastructure projects can be minimized with careful project design.},

Costa Rica is one of the Latin American countries that recognizes Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) by law although, so far, only few such types of certifications exist in the country. PGS schemes for promoting organic agriculture can be especially important for the vegetable sector of Costa Rica given the historically large use of agrochemicals in conventional (fruits and vegetables) production and its environmental and public health consequences. In this article, we use transition theory and the Multi-Level Perspective to analyze PGS for organic vegetables as a niche with a potential for but facing barriers to scaling out. Our literature review, supported by field surveys and observations, revealed different social and institutional barriers characterizing the niche–regime interactions which foster, or at times hamper, the scalability of PGS. Examples from other countries like Brazil and Mexico helped shed light on potential future paths for PGS in Costa Rica. Our results suggest that current institutional recognition of PGS might support scaling out if a more flexible legislative framework is implemented and political and technical support provided to participatory certification initiatives is increased.},

	abstract = {Pastoralism is a major occupation in Africa’s Sahel region, which spans from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east and has a semi-arid climate. Pastoralists from the region are usually nomadic, moving regularly in search of water and pasture, often for hundreds of kilometers. Traditionally, pastoralists have relied on historical knowledge and transhumance pathways to reach the water bodies (WB). Due to climatic conditions, a vast majority of the WBs in this region are small, sporadic, and ephemeral, therefore there is a need to map and frequently monitor water availability. Remote sensing observations can be used to complement current monitoring efforts. High-resolution near-daily imagery from the recently launched PlanetScope (PS) constellation of small satellites has the potential to complement the existing medium-resolution and infrequent but well established and extensively calibrated sensors like Landsat. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance and applicability of high-resolution PS data to detect and monitor WBs in the Ferlo region of West Africa, in comparison to Landsat-8 imagery. The results indicate that for cloud-free days, PS data was comparable (r {\textgreater}0.88; ubRMSE {\textless}0.01) to Landsat, but due to inadequate cloud masking, the results were poor for cloudy days (r {\textless} 0.49 and ubRMSE{\textgreater}0.058). The PS images were able to detect nearly 95\% of the WBs, whereas Landsat was able to identify only 32\% at the water fraction threshold {\textgreater}40\%. Initial results from this study show that the high spatial and temporal resolution PS datasets show promise in monitoring WBs in arid regions of West Africa.},

Although mounting evidence exists for how to facilitate individual action to address sustainability challenges, there is less understanding of how to foster collective action in this realm. To support research and practice promoting collective action to address sustainability issues, we deﬁne the term ‘‘collective environmental literacy’’ by delineating four key potent aspects: scale, dynamic processes, shared resources, and synergy. Building on existing collective constructs and thought, we highlight areas where researchers, practitioners, and policymakers can support individuals and communities as they come together to identify, develop, and implement solutions to wicked problems. We close by discussing limitations of this work and future directions in studying collective environmental literacy.},

The methodologies for the study are described. Three applications of the data are investigated. First, the puzzling “climate-output reversal” is detected, whereby the relationship between temperature and output is negative when measured on a per capita basis and strongly positive on a per area basis. Second, the database allows better resolution of the impact of geographic attributes on African poverty, finding geography is an important source of income differences relative to high-income regions. Finally, we use the G-Econ data to provide estimates of the economic impact of greenhouse warming, with larger estimates of warming damages than past studies.},

This assumes that knowledge and governance are separate and gives knowledge co-production the appearance of playing an informative and facilitative role in global environmental change governance. But seeking Indigenous knowledge to inform environmental decision-making implies that Indigenous peoples are stakeholders as opposed to self-determining nations with rights and responsibilities regarding their knowledge systems and lands. Indigenous sovereignty is not respected when knowledge is treated as mere data for collective decision-making. This paper brings literatures on knowledge co-production together with Indigenous knowledge, research, and environmental governance to explain why co-production scholars must move away from seeking to better ‘integrate’ Indigenous knowledges into western science and make way for Indigenous research leadership.},

Our objectives were to design and test the effectiveness of a source reduction intervention to improve caregiver knowledge and behaviors in coastal Kenya. Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial with 261 households from 5 control villages and 259 households from 5 intervention villages. From each household, one child (10–16 years old) and his or her primary caregiver participated in the intervention. We assessed caregiver knowledge and behavior at baseline, as well as 3 and 12 months after the intervention. We assessed household entomological indices at baseline and 12 months after the intervention to avoid seasonal interference. We conducted qualitative interviews with 34 caregivers to understand barriers and facilitators to change. We counted and weighed containers collected by children and parents during a community container clean-up and recycling event. After 12 months, caregiver knowledge about and self-reported behavior related to at least one source reduction technique was more than 50 percentage points higher in the intervention compared to control arm (adjusted risk differences for knowledge: 0.69, 95\% CI [0.56 to 0.82], and behavior: 0.58 [0.43 to 0.73]). Respondents stated that other family members’ actions were the primary barriers to proper container management. The number of containers at households did not differ significantly across arms even though children and parents collected 17,200 containers (1 ton of plastics) which were used to planted 4,000 native trees as part of the community event. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrates that source reduction interventions can be effective if designed with an understanding of the social and entomological context. Further, source reduction is not an individual issue, but rather a social/communal issue, requiring the participation of other household and community members to be sustained.},

Using the co-production of knowledge and social order (Jasanoff, 2004), this case study seeks to understand how some Indigenous communities are engaging in science-policy negotiations by linking traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), western science, and other knowledge systems. The analysis follows twenty years of Indigenous forest management negotiations between the Xáxli’p community and the Ministry of Forests in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, which resulted in the Xáxli’p Community Forest (XCF). The XCF is an eco-cultural restoration initiative that established an exclusive forest tenure for Xáxli’p over the majority of their aboriginal territory—a political shift that was co-produced with new articulations of Xáxli’p knowledge. This research seeks to understand knowledge co-production with Indigenous communities, and suggests that existing knowledge integration concepts are insufficient to address ongoing challenges with power asymmetries and Indigenous knowledge. Rather, this work proposes interpreting XCF knowledge production strategies through the framework of “Indigenous articulations,” where Indigenous peoples self-determine representations of their identities and interests in a contemporary socio-political context. This work has broader implications for considering how Indigenous knowledge is shaping science-policy negotiations, and vice versa.},

As a result, the aim of our study was to explore and examine the state of scientific evidence on the influences of these interactions on water-related infectious disease outcomes from a global perspective. A systematic review was conducted, using 54 peer-reviewed research articles published between 1995 and August 2019. The study revealed that there has been an increase in the number of publications since 2009; however, few of these publications (n = 6) made explicit linkages to the topic. It was found that urban and agricultural land-use changes had relatively high adverse impacts on water quality, due to high concentrations of fecal matter, heavy metals, and nutrients in surface water systems. Water systems were found as the common “vehicle” for infectious disease transmission, which in turn had linkages to sanitation and hygiene conditions. The study found explicit linkages between human–surface water interaction patterns and the transmission of water-based disease. However, weak and complex linkages were found between land-use change and the transmission of water-borne disease, due to multiple pathways and the dynamics of the other determinants of the disease. Therefore, further research studies, using interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to investigate and enhance a deeper understanding of these complexities and linkages among land use, surface water quality, and water-related infectious diseases, is crucial in developing integrated measures for sustainable water quality monitoring and diseases prevention.},

CBPR has generally been evaluated for its impact on policy, regulation, and its support of community science. However, there has been less emphasis on assessing the ways in which CBPR (re)shapes and potentially improves the scientific enterprise itself. This commentary focuses on this under-emphasized aspect of CBPR-how it can strengthen science. Using two case studies of environmental health CBPR research-the Northern California Exposure Study, and the San Joaquin Valley Drinking Water Study-we posit that CBPR helps improve the "3 R's"of science-rigor, relevance and reach-and in so doing benefits the scientific enterprise itself.},

While evidence shows that, overall, PAs have contributed to preserving forests, their impact varies greatly depending on the institutional context. This paper provides new evidence on the mechanisms through which local institutions shape the effectiveness of PAs. We use high-resolution satellite imagery of deforestation and illicit activities in Colombia and spatial regression discontinuity methods to estimate the causal effect of PAs in different institutional contexts. Our main results indicate that PAs significantly reduce deforestation, with larger effects for collective lands than national (strict-use) PAs, and no impact for regional (multiple-use) PAs. However, national PAs are only effective near human settlements, in municipalities that provide more public goods and are less violent. In remote areas, national PAs are particularly vulnerable to the expansion of coca crops and gold mining. In contrast, collective lands reduce coca crops and avoid deforestation in remote, less developed regions. These results highlight the extent to which natural PAs rely on the institutional capacity of the national and local governments, while collective lands protect forests even when state presence is weak.},

	abstract = {Moral duties concerning climate change mitigation are – for good reasons – conventionally construed as duties of institutional agents, usually states. Yet, in both scholarly debate and political discourse, it has occasionally been argued that the moral duties lie not only with states and institutional agents, but also with individual citizens. This argument has been made with regard to mitigation efforts, especially those reducing greenhouse gases. This paper focuses on the question of whether individuals in industrialized countries have duties to reduce their individual carbon footprint. To this end it will examine three kinds of arguments that have been brought forward against individuals having such duties: the view that individual emissions cause no harm; the view that individual mitigation efforts would have no morally significant effect; and the view that lifestyle changes would be overly-demanding. The paper shows how all three arguments fail to convince. While collective endeavours may be most efficient and effective in bringing about significant changes, there are still good reasons to contribute individually to reducing emission. After all, for most people the choice is between reducing one's individual emissions and not doing anything. The author hopes this paper shows that one should not opt for the latter.},

Low-intensity agricultural practices, however, may not sacrifice yields if they support biodiversity-driven ecosystem services. We quantified the value native predators provide to farmers by consuming coffee's most damaging insect pest, the coffee berry borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei). Our experiments in Costa Rica showed birds reduced infestation by 50\%, bats played a marginal role, and farmland forest cover increased pest removal. We identified borer-consuming bird species by assaying faeces for borer DNA and found higher borer-predator abundances on more forested plantations. Our coarse estimate is that forest patches doubled pest control over 230 km2 by providing habitat for 55 000 borer-consuming birds. These pest-control services prevented US\$75–US\$310 ha-year−1 in damage, a benefit per plantation on par with the average annual income of a Costa Rican citizen. Retaining forest and accounting for pest control demonstrates a win–win for biodiversity and coffee farmers.},

	abstract = {Emissions from 15 agricultural fires in the southeastern U.S. were measured from the NASA DC-8 research aircraft during the summer 2013 Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) campaign. This study reports a detailed set of emission factors (EFs) for 25 trace gases and 6 fine particle species. The chemical evolution of the primary emissions in seven plumes was examined in detail for 1.2 h. A Lagrangian plume cross-section model was used to simulate the evolution of ozone (O3), reactive nitrogen species, and organic aerosol (OA). Observed EFs are generally consistent with previous measurements of crop residue burning, but the fires studied here emitted high amounts of SO2 and fine particles, especially primary OA and chloride. Filter-based measurements of aerosol light absorption implied that brown carbon (BrC) was ubiquitous in the plumes. In aged plumes, rapid production of O3, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and nitrate was observed with ΔO3/ΔCO, ΔPAN/ΔNOy, and Δnitrate/ΔNOy reaching 0.1, 0.3, and 0.3. For five selected cases, the model reasonably simulated O3 formation but underestimated PAN formation. No significant evolution of OA mass or BrC absorption was observed. However, a consistent increase in oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios of OA indicated that OA oxidation in the agricultural fire plumes was much faster than in urban and forest fire plumes. Finally, total annual SO2, NOx, and CO emissions from agricultural fires in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri were estimated (within a factor of 2) to be equivalent to 2\% SO2 from coal combustion and 1\% NOx and 9\% CO from mobile sources.},

Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of such exposure and its population health impacts requires separating smoke-driven pollutants from non-smoke pollutants and a long time series to quantify patterns and measure health impacts. We develop a parsimonious and accurate machine learning model of daily wildfire-driven PM2.5 concentrations using a combination of ground, satellite, and reanalysis data sources that are easy to update. We apply our model across the contiguous US from 2006 to 2020, generating daily estimates of smoke PM2.5 over a 10 km-by-10 km grid and use these data to characterize levels and trends in smoke PM2.5. Smoke contributions to daily PM2.5 concentrations have increased by up to 5 μg/m3 in the Western US over the last decade, reversing decades of policy-driven improvements in overall air quality, with concentrations growing fastest for higher income populations and predominantly Hispanic populations. The number of people in locations with at least 1 day of smoke PM2.5 above 100 μg/m3 per year has increased 27-fold over the last decade, including nearly 25 million people in 2020 alone. Our data set can bolster efforts to comprehensively understand the drivers and societal impacts of trends and extremes in wildfire smoke.},

	abstract = {Interdisciplinary collaboration has become mainstream practice for sustainability researchers. However, interdisciplinary research teams encounter numerous challenges for which they may find themselves under-prepared. In this article, we challenge the often-held assumption that researchers already know how to collaborate when entering interdisciplinary research teams and argue that, if we want to enhance interdisciplinary sustainability research, we need to take collaboration and its challenges seriously. First, we suggest thinking about interdisciplinary research collaborations as spaces that comprise epistemic, social, symbolic, spatial, and temporal dimensions and that produce different degrees of comfort and discomfort for researchers. Thinking about collaborations in this way supports a more systematic understanding of collaborative challenges. Second, we make a proposal for learning to collaborate while collaborating, so as to tackle challenges of interdisciplinary research. Drawing on a literature review and on experiences in the project Leverage Points for Sustainability Transformation, we argue for advancing collaborative interdisciplinary research for sustainability by creating and engaging in collaborations in ways that prioritize learning to collaborate. We outline a strategy for learning to collaborate while collaborating, which implies: (1) creating conditions for learning to take place, which includes paying attention to discomfort as a trigger for learning and (2) engaging in collaborations in ways that strengthen researchers’ collaborative capacities by cultivating particular orientations, knowledge and skills. The fundamental inquiry is whether and how learning to collaborate has a role in more fully realizing the inspiring potentials and ambitious goals of interdisciplinary research for sustainability.},

	abstract = {The canonical difference-in-differences (DD) estimator contains two time periods, ”pre” and ”post”, and two groups, ”treatment” and ”control”. Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of two-way fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.},

	abstract = {Before widespread fire exclusion policies, American Indians used broadcast understory fires or cultural burns to enhance resources integral for their livelihood and cultural practices. To restore ecocultural resources depleted from decades of fire exclusion and to reduce wildfire risks, the Karuk and the Yurok Tribes of Northwest California are leading regional collaborative efforts to expand broadcast fires and fuel reduction treatments on public, private, and Tribal lands in their ancestral territories. Through collaboration with Karuk and Yurok Tribal members and basketweavers, we evaluated the effects of broadcast fires and three fire proxy treatments on California hazelnut shrubs (Corylus cornuta var. californica) that produce highly valued ecocultural resources for basketry materials. Across a 10 ha Douglas-fir and mixed hardwood forest (500 m a.s.l.) in the Klamath mountains, we established 27 stratified blocks (16 m2) and within each block applied three fire proxy treatments designed and used by Tribal members with an untreated control. These treatments involved manual hazelnut stem cutting, directly blistering hazelnut stems via propane torch, and igniting surface fuels piled within hazelnut shrubs to top-kill stems. Broadcast fire was applied to 12 separate blocks. After a full growing season (12–18 months post-treatment/burn), shrubs were re-measured. We then harvested these stems (n = 604; 50 shrubs) across treatments and compared results with stems gathered independently by two experienced Karuk/Yurok basketweavers (n = 396 and n = 73) from an adjacent broadcast burned site. Compared to the untreated shrubs, pile burning, propane torching, and broadcast burning increased basketry stem production by 7–10 fold (p {\textless} 0.001), while the cutting treatment increased production by 4-fold (p = 0.006). Shrubs with relatively greater access to sunlight (southern aspect, ≥51\% and {\textless}70\% canopy cover) produced fewer quality stems when compared to shrubs with an eastern aspect (p {\textless} 0.01) and ≥70\% canopy cover (p {\textless} 0.05). Harvested stems across all treatments displayed similar stem length distributions to those gathered by one of the two basketweavers (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Our results demonstrate that these fire-proxy methods are an effective means to increase the production and quality of basketry materials. Expanding the area and frequency of targeted understory fire-based forest treatments on private, public and Tribal lands in California and the Pacific Northwest would substantially increase the availability of these fire-enhanced ecocultural resources that are currently limited in supply and in high demand.},

We investigate the relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and learning outcomes across the United States using standardized test scores from 2009–2016 for nearly 11,700 school districts and satellite-derived estimates of daily smoke exposure. Relative to a school year with no smoke, average cumulative smoke-attributable PM2.5 (surface particulate matter {\textless}2.5 μg m−3) exposure during the school year ({\textasciitilde}35 μg m−3) reduces test scores by {\textasciitilde}0.15\% of a standard deviation. These impacts are more pronounced among younger students and are observed across differing levels of economic disadvantage and racial/ethnic composition. Additionally, we project that smoke PM2.5 exposure in 2016 reduced discounted future earnings by nearly \$1.7 billion (\$111 per student). Roughly 80\% of these costs are borne by disadvantaged districts. Our findings quantify a previously unaccounted for social cost of wildfire that is likely to worsen under a warming climate.},

To help overcome these barriers, this paper provides practical advice for early career researchers and their mentors, as well as senior researchers and lab leaders, in the form of 10 tips: ‘Develop an area of expertise’; ‘Learn new languages’; ‘Be open-minded’; ‘Be patient’; ‘Embrace complexity’; ‘Collaborate widely; ‘Push your boundaries’; ‘Consider if you will engage in interdisciplinary research’; ‘Foster interdisciplinary culture’; and ‘Champion interdisciplinary researchers’.

SUMMARY


Develop an area of expertise


bring an expert perspective to the interdisciplinary table comfortably, confidently and most importantly, competently


discipline, place, field of study, method, or a process






Learn new languages


jargon is confusing, differences in the use of terms across disciplines can generate confusion; increase fluency




Be open-minded


open to learning new ways of doing things and new collaborations that include new types of disciplinary knowledge and non-academic knowledge


remain humble




Be patient


learning cycle and transaction time can lengthen when collaborators need to understand different disciplinary cultures, languages and approaches


iterative process


trust building is key




Embrace complexity


difficulty can be good, can help to understand the bigger picture


find patterns across scales that you may not have known about otherwise




Collaborate widely


check your ego, learn the nuances and differences in thought and approaches among disciplines


“its not a relay race” - aka run together




Push your boundaries


challenge yourself, try new things big and small, expose yourself to novel perspectives




Consider if and how you will engage in IDR


personal skills + outlooks different between IDR and disciplinart researchers




Foster interdisciplinary culture


foster safe spaces where admitting to now knowing something is okay, challenge jargon and engage and invite researchers from a variety of disciplines into meetings


support interdisciplinary skill development in early career researchers




Champion researchers emphasise engaging in, and supporting, IDR


create high profile awards, developing mechanisms to recognize excellence within IDR





CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF WORK


Why this study matters


defines the “journey” of the “undisciplinary”


thinking about being problem driven instead of knowledge driven


discusses the importance of collaboration  


thinking about how to situate yourself if what types of knowing




Assumptions it makes







Limitations


don’t love the term undisciplinary


would be curious to see a follow up study now to see if any seniments have changed




Reliability/caveats


the chart with conceptual lala land vs epistemological




REFLECTIONS


How this work applies to your own question


really liked the concept of EA and want to internalize this in my own work




What surprised you

SHORT SUMMARY
brief medium opinion piece on interdisciplinary studies that discusses:


from philosopher kinds who had no discipline to now being so disciplined, where is the middle ground? how can we contribute new knowledge to a field


traditional academia is rooted in disciplines now, how do we move away from this, where do we fit in?


there is so much to do, where can students make an impact? what is the goal of an interdisciplinary degree


there are different models when it comes to the types of problems that students may work and how they approach answering them


“use inspired” or “problem driven”





models:


“T -Model ” - goes deep, but informed by breadth. mostly qusetion is based in one discipline, but can be informed by other disciplines and how they think about “drivers”


“Pi-Model” - depth in two areas connected by a framework. question requires going in depth in two different fields, where one fields methods/thinking can inform the other. each discipline may be very linked where one var/outcome is the input var for the next analysis for the other discipline. alternatively, loosely linked studies in same landscape


“O-Model” - feedback between disciplines, systems thinking approach, as knowledge is gained in one discipline it influences and informs the other disciplines and so on. questions might be in simulation or dynamic modelling approaches.





REFLECTIONS


How this work applies to your own question


made me think more about where my own work falls and where i want to be going


think my work is going to mostly fall into the pi model but would be interested in expanding this to be more aligned with the O model too


believe that an understanding of context and economics will help inform the drivers of disease outcomes for my research question 




think about what are the best ways to ask this question, what knowledge do i gain by answering the question i am asking, and what tools will be the most effective?


most importantly need to converse between fields




What surprised you


not necessarily needing as much methods grounding if not going into academia


just because a course may not be relevant immediately or a certain set of knowledge, it may become relevant later. keep notes, store ideas and see what happens

The respiratory physiology of some species is adapted to operate at very low oxygen concentrations and they are able to survive for long periods in anaerobic conditions. The reproductive rate of L. hoffmeisteri is also unaltered by decrease in dissolved oxygen to very low concentrations. Heavy ions, such as copper, are likely to eliminate tubificids, but the insecticide BHC may cause an increase in tubicifids while other aquatic invertebrates are eliminated. Warm condenser effluents are likely to increase the abundance of L. hoffmeisteri and, in some cases, provide suitable conditions for colonisation by the exotic tubificid, Branchiura sowerbyi. An evaluation is made of the possible use of tubificids as indicators of water quality.},

	abstract = {Background: 

Outdoor fine particulate air pollution, {\textless}2.5 µm (PM2.5) mass concentrations can be constructed through many different combinations of chemical components that have varying levels of toxicity. This poses a challenge for studies interested in estimating the health effects of total outdoor PM2.5 (i.e., how much PM2.5 mass is present in the air regardless of composition) because we must consider possible confounders of the version of treatment-outcome relationships.

Methods:

We evaluated the extent of possible bias in mortality hazard ratios for total outdoor PM2.5 by examining models with and without adjustment for sulfate and nitrate in PM2.5 as examples of potential confounders of version of treatment-outcome relationships. Our study included approximately 3 million Canadians and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for total outdoor PM2.5 adjusting for sulfate and/or nitrate and other relevant covariates.

Results:

Hazard ratios for total outdoor PM2.5 and nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were overestimated due to the confounding version of treatment-outcome relationships, and associations for lung cancer mortality were underestimated. Sulfate was most strongly associated with nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality suggesting that regulations targeting this specific component of outdoor PM2.5 may have greater health benefits than interventions targeting total PM2.5.

Conclusions:

Studies interested in estimating the health impacts of total outdoor PM2.5 (i.e., how much PM2.5 mass is present in the air) need to consider potential confounders of the version of treatment-outcome relationships.

Introduction
La chaleur élevée est cause de surmortalité dans la population, même dans notre pays. Un épisode de vague de chaleur important à Marseille en 1983 a entraîné la mise en place d’une prévention par messages d’alerte depuis 1984.
Objectif
Comparer la surmortalité chez les personnes de 65 ans et plus lors des vagues de chaleur estivale avant et après une intervention à Marseille.
Méthode
Les données de mortalité de l’Insee (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques) ont été analysées en fonction des températures moyennes fournies par la Météorologie nationale de 1968 à 1997. Un index de mortalité a été construit pour limiter l’effet de l’évolution de la mortalité en 30 ans. La vague de chaleur est définie par une température ≥ 26 ̊C pendant au moins 2 jours lors des mois de juin à août.

La température moyenne estivale à Marseille est passée de 22 à 23 ̊C en 30 ans. Le nombre de jours de vague de chaleur a augmenté lui aussi pendant cette période. L’index moyen de surmortalité journalier est passé de 3,27 entre 1968-82 à 1,32 entre 1984-97 (p = 0,008).
Conclusion
Sur une période de 30 ans, les effets du réchauffement climatique sont observés à Marseille. Nous n’avons pas montré une disparition de la surmortalité, mais la prévention semble au moins partiellement efficace, même si cette efficacité peut être due à d’autres facteurs (climatisation…). Cette prévention, comme celle des risques liés à la pollution, devrait être généralisée car elle est peu coûteuse en moyens, mais l’évaluation précise de son efficacité est difficile.
Summary
Introduction
High temperatures induce excess mortality in the population, even in our country. The 1983 heat wave in Marseille led to the development of warning messages in a preventive campaign since 1984.
Objective
To compare mortality of people over 65 years old during summer heat waves before and after a campaign in Marseille.
Method
the INSEE mortality data were analysed according to the mean temperatures supplied by the National Meteorological Office from 1968 to 1997. A mortality index was developed to limit the effect of the progression in mortality over the last 30 years. The heat wave was defined as a temperature ≥ 26̊C lasting for 2 days during the months of June to August.
Results
The mean summer temperature in Marseille has increased from 22 to 23̊C in 30 years. The number of days of heat wave has also increased during this period. The mean index of daily excess mortality has dropped from 3.27 (1968-82) to 1.32 (1984-97) (p = 0.008).
Conclusion
The effects of global warming have been noted in Marseilles over the last 30 years. There has been no disappearance in excess mortality, but the warning messages appear to have been partially effective, even if other factors may have intervened (air-conditioning…). This prevention, like that for the risks related to air pollution, should be generalized because it is inexpensive, although assessment of its efficacy is difficult.},

	abstract = {Background: Extreme heat is a well-documented public health threat. The US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat advisories and warnings (collectively, “heat alerts”) in advance of forecast extreme heat events. The eﬀectiveness of these alerts in preventing deaths remains largely unknown.
Objectives: To quantify the change in mortality rates associated with heat alerts in 20 US cities between 2001 and 2006.
Methods: Because NWS heat alerts are issued based on forecast weather and these forecasts are imperfect, in any given location there exists a set of days of similar observed heat index in which heat alerts have been issued for some days but not others. We used a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to compare mortality rates on days with versus without heat alerts among such eligible days, adjusting for maximum daily heat index and temporal factors. We combined city-speciﬁc estimates into a summary measure using standard random-eﬀects meta-analytic techniques.
Results: Overall, NWS heat alerts were not associated with lower mortality rates (percent change in rate: −0.5\% [95\% CI: -2.8, 1.9]). In Philadelphia, heat alerts were associated with a 4.4\% (95\% CI: -8.3, −0.3) lower mortality rate or an estimated 45.1 (95\% empirical CI: 3.1, 84.1) deaths averted per year if this association is assumed to be causal. No statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁcial association was observed in other individual cities.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that between 2001 and 2006, NWS heat alerts were not associated with lower mortality in most cities studied, potentially missing a valuable opportunity to avert a substantial number of heatrelated deaths. These results highlight the need to better link alerts to eﬀective communication and intervention strategies to reduce heat-related mortality.},

In addition to the need to assess future urban heat-related health risks, there is also an increasing need to design adaptation strategies that will be effective under varying levels of socioeconomic development and climate change. We use the case study of Houston, Texas, to develop and demonstrate a scenario-based approach to explore the effectiveness of both autonomous and planned heat-related adaptations under multiple plausible futures. We couple a heat risk model with urban climate projections (under the Representative Concentration Pathways) and vulnerability projections (under locally extended Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) to investigate the impact of different adaptation strategies under multiple scenario combinations. We demonstrate that, in the context of Houston, community-based adaptation strategies aiming to reduce social isolation are the most effective and the least challenging to implement across all plausible futures. Scenario-based approaches can provide local policymakers with context-specific assessments of possible adaptation strategies that account for uncertain futures.},

	abstract = {Background
Heat waves can be considered as an emerging challenge among the potential health risks generated by urbanization and climate changes. Heat waves are becoming more frequent, long and intense, and can be defined as meteorological extreme events consisting in prolonged time of extremely high temperatures in a particular region. The following paper addresses health threats due to heat waves presenting the case study of Lecce, a city located in Southern Italy; the Mediterranean area is already recognized in international literature as a hot-spot for climate changes. This work assesses the potential impact of two different adaptation strategies. Methods: We have tested the effectiveness of cool surfaces and urban forestry as adaptation approaches to cope with heat waves. The microclimate computer-based model “ENVI-met” was adopted to predict thermal scenarios arising from the two proposed interventions. The parameters analysed consisted in temperature and relative humidity. Results: Urban forestry approach seem to lower temperature (that represents the major cause of urban overheating) better than cool surfaces strategy, but relative humidity produced by the evapotranspiration processes of urban forestry has also negative influences on temperature perceived by pedestrians (thermal discomfort). Conclusion: Vegetation represents both an adaptation and a mitigation strategy to climate changes that guarantees an improvement of air quality, with consequent psychological and physical benefits. Wide campaigns aimed at planting trees and increasing the urban green coverage should be systematically planned and fostered by national, regional and local institutions preferably with the involvement of research departments, schools and citizens’ associations.},

	abstract = {The July 1999 heat wave in the Midwest was an event of relatively long duration punctuated by extreme conditions during its last 2 days. The intensity of the heat wave on 29 and 30 July rivaled that of the 1995 heat wave that killed more than 1000 people in the central United States. In 1999, however, the death toll was about one-fourth of this amount in the same region. The 1999 heat wave 2-day maximum apparent temperature was slightly less than during the 1995 heat wave at most Midwestern first-order stations. In addition, the 2-day peak was preceded by several hot days that allowed some short-term acclimatization to occur prior to the intense final days. In Chicago, conditions during the peak of the 1999 heat wave were very similar to those during the 1995 heat wave peak, especially the extreme nocturnal conditions of temperatures and humidity. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the reduction in the heat wave death toll in Chicago from about 700 in 1995 to 114 in 1999 is due solely to meteorological differences between the two heat waves. In St. Louis, the 1999 heat wave was intense for a much longer duration than the 1995 heat wave, thus partially explaining the increase in heat-related deaths there from the 1995 event to the 1999 event. An examination of heat wave response efforts in both Chicago and St. Louis leads to the conclusion that both cities were quite effective at mitigating their respective heat wave mortality rates, which in the 1999 event were almost exactly the same in both metropolitan areas. This represents a great improvement for the city of Chicago compared to the 1995 heat wave. Suggestions are made for further improving municipal heat wave response efforts based on the 1999 experience.},

More studies are needed in tropical systems in order to assess contamination risks to non-target endemic tropical species from the extensive use of pesticides e.g. in banana and pineapple plantations. In this study, acute laboratory toxicity tests with organophosphate pesticides ethoprophos and chlorpyrifos were conducted on two Costa Rican species, cladoceran Daphnia ambigua and fish Parachromis dovii. Tests showed that chlorpyrifos was more toxic than ethoprophos to D. ambigua and P. dovii and that D. ambigua was also more sensitive than P. dovii to both pesticides. Chemical analyses of field water revealed that fungicides were generally the most frequent pesticide group found, followed by insecticides/nematicides and herbicides. The bioassays and values obtained from the literature confirmed that D. magna was more sensitive to pesticide contamination than P. dovii and that D. ambigua was more sensitive than D. magna, suggesting that the native cladoceran is a more suitable test species than its temperate counterpart.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world are responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many policies, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society; however, their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2–4. Here we compile data on 1,700 local, regional and national non-pharmaceutical interventions that were deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States. We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of approximately 38\% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different effects on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages that were deployed to reduce the rate of transmission achieved large, beneficial and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections. These findings may help to inform decisions regarding whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified or lifted, and they can support policy-making in the more than 180 other countries in which COVID-19 has been reported7.},

	abstract = {Water quality monitoring can inform policies that address pollution; however, inconsistent measurement and reporting practices render many observations incomparable across bodies of water, thereby impeding efforts to characterize spatial patterns and long-term trends in pollution. Here, we harmonized 9.2 million publicly available monitor readings from 226 distinct water monitoring authorities spanning the entirety of the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB) in the United States. We created the Standardized Nitrogen and Phosphorus Dataset (SNAPD), a novel dataset of 4.8 million standardized observations for nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing compounds from 107 thousand sites during 1980–2018. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset represents the largest record of these pollutants in a single river network where measurements can be compared across time and space. We addressed numerous well-documented issues associated with the reporting and interpretation of these water quality data, heretofore unaddressed at this scale, and our approach to water quality data processing can be applied to other nutrient compounds and regions.},
