      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Emma is interested in exploring how we can promote the health of people and the environment in a changing world. Her research aims to measure, value, and predict the impacts of global environmental change on our ecosystems, environmental quality, and human health. She leverages different types and scales of data, including field collected ecological data to remotely sensed data to epidemiological data on human health outcomes, and she relates these datasets together by drawing on methods and tools from various disciplines, such as machine learning, causal inference, and exposure assessment. Her current research focuses on how changes to air quality, land use, and water quality, which are three resources that are critical to the functioning of healthy ecosystems have consequences for both the environment and human health. Emma is co-advised by Erin Mordecai and Marshall Burke, and she is a NSF Graduate Research Fellow, a Stanford EDGE Fellow, and a Stanford Data Science Scholar.

Prior to starting her PhD, Emma worked as a Research Analyst at the Global Policy Lab at UC Berkeley (now at Stanford). During her time at GPL, she was part of a project that aimed to identify land-based sources of nonpoint source water pollution in national-scale river systems in New Zealand and the US Mississippi River Basin. Emma completed her MPH in global and environmental health science and global health at Columbia University and received a BA in behavioral neuroscience from Colgate University.

When she isnâ€™t at her desk, you can find her outside - most likely running or hiking up a mountain. She also co-founded a trivia company and loves to host trivia nights to bring communities together.
